## Abandon Trade Goods
Abandoning trade goods removes them from one's assets, which (depending on the type of trade goods being abandoned) may reduce the need for transport or allow for faster movement.

## Abbess
The head of a Convent is the Abbess. She is appointed by the Grandmaster of the monastic order to which the Convent belongs. When the Convent is not affiliated with a particular monastic order, she is appointed by the Bishop in whose see the Convent is located. Appointees must be tonsured females.

## Abbot
The head of an Abbey is the Abbot. He is appointed by the Grandmaster of the monastic order to which the Abbey belongs. When an Abbey is not affiliated with a specific monastic order, its abbot is appointed by the Bishop in whose see the Abbey is located. Appointees must be tonsured males. Abbots are members of their Cathedral Chapter.

## Action
All acts carried out by a character constitute an Action. Most Actions entail the expenditure of an Initiative. Characters who have sufficient Initiatives may execute multiple Actions during the same day.

## Aid
A character present at a town over which he is sovereign may collect a feudal Aid in coins equal to 5% of the town's wealth. The funds are taken from the town's wealth. The sovereign's family loses 100 points of loyalty at the town. The sovereign's administrative skill may not be used again for seven days.

## Alcohol
Wine, beer, ale or spirits may be given to troops, or crew, to raise their morale. No more than one unit of alcohol may be imbibed per man per day. The increase per unit of alcohol is equal to 20 plus one one thousandth of the character's intoxication rating. Should the number of units of alcohol be smaller than the number of recipients, the morale increase is proportionately reduced. (To qualify to be used for this purpose, it is not sufficient that a trade good be a type of alcohol, wine, ale, beer or spirits. It must be listed as wine, beer, ale or spirits in the asset list of the character.)

## Amercement
Amercements accumulate at each town each day. The tenant may collect these amercements. Each time he collects amercements, he may collect a maximum of four coins for each point in his law skill rating. Doing so ties up his law skill for 24 hours.

## Anathema
The Pope may anathematize a Catholic. Doing so reduces the latter's reputation for piety by a number of points equal to 10% of the Pope's sermonizing skill. It ties up that skill for one week, and uses up one initiative.

## Annates
When a Bishop, or Archbishop, takes office, his customary payment to the Pope is simulated by the automatic transfer to the Pope of the tithe accumulation at the seat of the bishopric, or archbishopric.

## Annulment of Marriage
Upon request, the Pope may annul Catholic marriages for a fee of 10,000 coins. Doing so ties up his administration skill for seven days.

## Apostolic Protonotary
The Pope may appoint any number of Apostolic Protonotaries. Only tonsured Catholic males with law skill ratings of at least 1,000 are eligible. 25 coins are paid by the Pope to each Apostolic Protonotary each day. The Pope receives 0.1 extra initiatives each day per Apostolic Protonotary. Apostolic Protonotaries gain 0.1 prestige per day. When appointing an Apostolic Protonotary, the Pope may indicate that he is replacing a specific existing Apostolic Protonotary -- thereby removing him from this office.

## Archpriest
The head of a Church is the Archpriest. He is appointed by the Bishop in whose see the Church is located. Archpriests receive a daily salary (extracted from town wealth) of 0.00001 times their town's wealth. Appointees must have a reputation for piety of at least 400 and be tonsured males. Archpriests affect the effectiveness of attending mass. They are members of their Cathedral Chapter.

## Armor
Armor is used to equip heavy cavalry. It may also be used to meet a town's demand for weapons. Armor may be produced through the expenditure of one iron and ten coins per unit of armor. Coins expended to produce armor are added to the town's wealth. In one action, a character may produce a maximum number of units of armor equal to half of the square root of his smithery rating. His smithery rating may not be used again for seven days minus a number of minutes equal to the total of his smithery rating plus the rating of the town's armory structure. When armor is produced in a town with a pre-existing Armory, the Armory increases in size by 0.1 points.

## Archbishop
Archbishops are selected by their Cathedral Chapter. The members of their Cathedral Chapter consist of all archpriests and abbots in their archiepiscopal see plus all bishops subject to their archiepiscopal see. The Pope and any Nuncio present are able to vote as ex officio members. In addition to votes actively cast, candidates receive a number of votes equal to their reputation for piety divided by 300 plus their politics skill divided by 1,000 plus their prestige divided by 1,000. To qualify for election, a candidate must vote for himself. Upon election a new archbishop is divested of any other episcopal titles he may hold. When an archbishop is elected, all accumulated tithes held in the seat of his archbishopric are transferred to the Pope as Annates.

Archbishops participate in the selection of bishops whose sees fall under their rule. Archbishops have the rights of bishops over towns that are under their direct episcopal rule. Archbishops gain 0.3 prestige per day.

## Arquebus
Arquebuses are used to equip arquebusiers. They may also be used to meet a town's demand for weapons. Arquebuses may be produced through the expenditure of a total of one one unit of iron, one timber, one sulfur, one saltpeter and one charcoal plus one coin per arquebus. Coins expended to produce arquebuses are added to the town's wealth. In one action, a character may produce a number of arquebuses equal to the square root of his gunsmithing rating. His gunsmithing rating may not be used again for three days minus a number of minutes equal to the total of his gunsmithing rating plus the rating of the town's armory structure. When arquebuses are produced in a town with a pre-existing Armory, the Armory increases in size by 0.1 points.

## Arquebusiers
To recruit arquebusiers, one must expend 40 coins and one arquebus per recruit. Each character may hold 200 arquebusiers free of maintenance. Any additional arquebusiers require 0.2 units of grain per day in maintenance. If unmaintained, these excess arquebusiers suffer one percent attrition per day. Arquebusiers fight most effectively in forested terrain. They provide suppressing fire in assaults on towns or strongpoints.

## Assassination
Assassination attempts may be carried out by males with an assassination skill rating greater than zero. Attempts take place immediately upon being ordered. They cause the victim to suffer a health loss equal to one-tenth of the total of the following: the assassin's assassination rating minus 100 plus the assassin's health rating minus one-tenth of the victim's personal troop total (excluding crew) minus the victim's assassination skill rating minus one-tenth of the location's hospital size minus half the value of the victim's family's strongpoint at the location. (Aa-100+Ha-T/10-Av-Ho/10-S/2)/20. (Aa = assassin's assassination rating; Ha = assassin's health rating; T = victim's personal troop total including crew; Av = victim's assassination skill rating; Ho = location's hospital size; S = the victim's family's strongpoint at the location). If the victim's health rating is at, or below, zero at the time of the next daily update, he dies. Assassination skill may be used no more than once per 60 days. Each assassination attempt reduces the potential assassin's prestige by 300 points. The name of the perpetrator of an assassination attempt is mentioned in the events listing.

## Assault
Three types of assault are possible: assaults on towns for plunder (see 'plunder'), assaults on towns for de facto control (see 'assault for control'), and assaults on strongpoints to destroy the strongpoint (see 'assault strongpoint'.)
To initiate an assault, a character must have a minimum of 100 points of prestige and one initiative.
If the attacker is the local commander for a league, all league members present at the town participate in the attack.
If the attacker is a league member, but not the local commander, he receives no support from other league members.
Court Office troops present at the location participate on the side of the holder of the Court Office.

In League assaults, the 'assaulter's loyalty' rating is that of the family of the character who issued the assault order. The 'assaulter's strongpoint' rating is that of the family of the character who issued the assault order. The participation of other families in the assaulting alliance does not increase the 'assaulter's loyalty' rating nor the 'assaulter's strongpoint' rating.

For every hundred troops his side loses in an assault, an assaulter gains one point of military skill and loses one point of prestige. For every hundred troops he kills in an assault, he gains one point of prestige.

## Assault a town to take de facto control
An individual may order his troops to assault a town for the purpose of taking de facto control (DFC). Assault orders are executed 72 hours after they are initiated. In assaults only auxiliaries climb the walls. They are supported by suppressing fire from the assaulter's bowmen and arquebusiers. Cavalry, pikemen and feudal levies do not participate in assaults. When all defending garrison troops are killed, the character ordering the assault takes de facto control of the town. Should any garrison troops survive, the assault fails and DFC remains unchanged. 
An assault starts with the infliction of casualties upon the assaulting auxiliaries by the defending garrison troops. Each garrison troop kills a number of auxiliaries equal to ((N-B-Q) x FAS/1000)/1,000. (N=the town's total loyalty to all families minus twice the town's loyalty to the asssaulter's family. B=the attacker's number of bowmen times their morale divided by 3,000. Q=the attacker's number of arquebusiers times their morale divided by 3,000. FAS=the town's Fortification Against Assault. If N-B-Q is calculated to be less than 100, then N-B-Q is deemed to be 100.) The assaulter's surviving auxiliaries each kill the defending garrison troops according to the following formula: M/1000 x (Mi/1000+S/1000). (M=the auxiliaries' morale. Mi=the assaulter's military rating. S=the size of the assaulter's strongpoint, if any, at the location being assaulted.)
Succeeding in taking de facto control of a location does not give the assaulter the benefits of plunder. Morale changes are equal to 1/10th of the difference in total kills extracted.

## Assault a strongpoint
An individual may order his troops to assault and destroy a strongpoint. Assault orders are executed 72 hours after they are initiated. In assaults only auxiliaries climb the walls. They are supported by suppressing fire from the assaulter's bowmen and arquebusiers. Cavalry, pikemen and feudal levies do not participate directly in assaults. When all defending garrison troops are killed, the strongpoint and all of its contents, are destroyed. When any garrison troops survive, the strongpoint remains unscathed.
An assault starts with the infliction of casualties upon the assaulting auxiliaries by the defending garrison troops. Each garrison troop kills a number of auxiliaries equal to (S-B-Q) x S/1000. (S=the size of the strongpoint. B=the attacker's number of bowmen times their morale divided by 3,000. Q=the attacker's number of arquebusiers times their morale divided by 3,000. If S-B-Q is calculated to be less than 100, then S-B-Q is deemed to be 100.) The assaulter's surviving auxiliaries each kill the defending garrison troops according to the following formula: M/1000 x Mi/1000. (M=the auxiliaries' morale. Mi=the assaulter's military rating.) Morale changes are equal to 1/10th of the difference in total kills extracted.

## Assize
The feudatory of a location may hold an assize. Doing so increases loyalty to his family at that town by a number of points equal to one plus the square root of half of his prestige. A character who holds an assize may not use law skill again for 48 hours.

## Auctions
Each day an exotic trade good will be put up for auction. The type of trade good is determined through a daily vote in which each player is able to cast a number of ballots equal to his seniority vote count. This action uses no intiatives and does not expend any seniority votes. When a player casts such ballots, all characters in his family who have a rating for politics skill have one point added to their rating for this skill.

## Auxiliaries
To recruit auxiliaries, one must expend 20 coins and one unit of swords per recruit. Each character may hold 200 auxiliaries free of maintenance. Any additional auxiliaries require 0.1 units of grain per day in maintenance. If unmaintained, these excess auxiliaries suffer one percent attrition per day. Auxiliaries fight most effectively in mountain terrain. They are the only troops that can assault the walls of towns or strongpoints.

## Banishment
The Justiciar to the local sovereign may banish a character from that location. Banishment lasts for one year. The Justiciar may not use his law skill again for seven days.

## Banker Loan
The maximum number of coins a banker may lend in one loan is equal to 50 times his banking skill rating. If the town's bank structure has a lower rating than the banker's banking rating, the maximum loan he may offer is equal to 25 times the banker's banking skill rating plus 25 times the town's bank structure rating. The largest loan a character may accept is one for no more than 50 coins per point of prestige he has at the time of his acceptance. Bankers may offer loans for lesser amounts. Offering a banker loan ties up the banker's banking skill for 48 hours. A bank loan offered to a single individual from a single banker may not bring the debtor's total debt to that banker to a level greater than the banker's current maximum loan offer. During the daily update, a number of coins equal to the total debt times 0.003 is transferred from the borrower to the lender as an interest payment. A debtor who cannot make a daily interest payment loses one point of prestige that day. Debts may be paid off at any time.

## Barque
Barques are ships used for 'riverine' and 'coastal' transport. They are not allowed to engage in 'sea' movement. Each barque can carry 100 units of cargo. Barques will not sail with fewer than ten crew. To build a barque, one must have a barquebuilding rating of at least 900 and expend 100 timber, 100 cordage, 100 pitch, 1 sail and 100 coins. The coins are added to the town's wealth. The builder may not use his barquebuilding skill again for ten days minus a number of minutes equal to three times the total of his barquebuilding skill and the town's shipyard structure rating. No maintenance attrition is extracted from a character's first barque. Additional barques deteriorate by one-tenth of one percent each day.

## Battles
To issue battle orders, a character must have a prestige rating of at least 100 and at least one point of military skill. Land battle orders may be issued to engage other characters in field battle, to assault towns or strongpoints (see 'Assault'), or to bombard towns or strongpoints (see 'Siege Bombardment'. For every hundred troops his side loses in field battle, a character gains one point of military skill and loses one point of prestige. For every hundred troops his side kills in field battle, he gains one point of prestige. The character who initiates the battle, or is the designated defender in a battle, gains an additional one point of military skill. Court Office assets at the same location as the holder of the Court Office fight on his side. Issuing battle orders increases a character's military skill by one point. Battle orders may be canceled at any time prior to the occurrence of the battle. Canceling battle orders costs the canceler three points of prestige. Issuing battle orders against someone with whom one is in a marriage alliance reduces the attacker's prestige by 300 points.

## Begging
Begging costs the beggar one point of prestige. He receives a number of coins equal to 1/100 of the town's almshouse structure rating. These coins are extracted from the town's wealth.

## Bishop
Bishops are elected by their Cathedral Chapter. The members of their Cathedral Chapter consist of all archpriests and abbots in their episcopal see. The Pope, the Archbishop overseeing the bishopric and any Nuncio present are able to vote as ex officio members. In addition to votes actively cast, candidates receive a number of votes equal to their reputation for piety divided by 300 plus their politics skill divided by 1,000 plus their prestige divided by 1,000. To qualify for election, a candidate must vote for himself. Upon election a new bishop is divested of any other episcopal title he may hold. When a bishop is elected, all accumulated tithes held in the seat of his bishopric are transferred to the Pope as Annates.

Bishops appoint archpriests for Churches located in towns within their episcopal sees. When an Abbey, or Convent, is not affiliated with a specific monastic order, Bishops appoint their Abbot, or Abbess. Bishops may collect the tithes accumulated in the towns within their see. Collecting tithes ties up their administrative skill for 48 hours minus a number of minutes equal to their administrative skill. Bishops gain 0.2 prestige per day.

## Blockade
Three types of blockades are possible: market blockades, road blockades and naval blockades. Anyone with one, or more, land troops may institute a road blockade, or a market blockade. Anyone with fully-crewed ships not overloaded with cargo may institute a naval blockade. Blockades apply to anyone who is neither a member of the blockader's family, nor a member of the same League as the blockader. When a market is blockaded, no one to whom it applies may buy goods from the townspeople, nor sell goods to the townspeople. When a road is being blockaded, no one to whom it applies may leave the town in any direction except the one whence he came. When a naval blockade has been established, anyone to whom it applies who arrives at, or leaves from, the town by water is automatically engaged in naval battle with the naval blockader. Blockades last until they are terminated by the blockader, or ended by his departure from the town. A town may have no more than one naval blockade active at any one time. Establishing a blockade ends any pre-existing blockades being conducted by the establisher of the new blockade.

## Bombardment of strongpoint
Siege bombardment can be used to reduce the size of a strongpoint. Bombardment orders are executed 72 hours after they are issued. Each cannon reduces the strongpoint by a number of points equal to the bombarder's gunnery rating divided by 500. Each cannon suffers impairment of 2% each time it is used in bombardment.

## Bombardment of town
Siege bombardment can be used to reduce the FAS (Fortification Against Assault) of a town. Bombardment orders are executed 72 hours after they are issued. Each cannon reduces FAS by a number of points equal to 1/500th of the excess of the bombarder's gunnery rating over the town's FAR (Fortification Against Artillery). Each cannon suffers impairment of 2% each time it is used in bombardment.

## Bow
Bows are used to equip bowmen. They may also be used to meet a town's demand for weapons. Bows may be produced through the expenditure of one coin per bow plus a total of one unit of timber for whatever number of bows is produced. Coins expended to produce bows are added to the town's wealth. In one action, a character may produce a number of bows equal to the square root of his bowyery rating. His bowyery rating may not be used again for three days minus a number of minutes equal to the total of his bowyery rating plus the rating of the town's armory structure. When bows are produced in a town with a pre-existing Armory, that Armory increases in size by 0.1 points.

## Bowmen
To recruit bowmen, one must expend 80 coins and one bow per recruit. Each character may hold 200 bowmen free of maintenance. Any additional bowmen require 0.1 units of grain per day in maintenance. If unmaintained, these excess bowmen suffer one percent attrition per day. Bowmen are most effective in swampy terrain. They provide suppressing fire in assaults on towns or strongpoints.

## Bulletin Board
Any player may make a posting to the Bulletin Board at any time. Doing so does not use up an initiative. During the daily update, each character belonging to the poster's family, and possessed of a letters rating higher than zero, receives a rating increase of 0.1 points. This rating increase may be earned once per day. Players are encouraged to post their email addresses.

## Camels
Camels are used for overland transport. Each camel may carry four units of cargo. A character's first one hundred camels require no maintenance. Additional camels require 0.2 units of grain per day. Unmaintained additional camels suffer losses of one percent per day.

## Cancel battle orders
Battle orders may be cancelled at any time prior to the occurrence of the battle. Cancelling battle orders costs the canceller three points of prestige.

## Cannon
Cannons are used to reduce fortifications. They may also be used to meet a town's demand for weapons. To be able to produce a cannon, one must have a cannonmaking rating of at least 900. To make one cannon, one must expend 100 iron, 10 saltpeter, 10 sulfur, 10 charcoal and 100 coins. Coins expended to produce a cannon are added to the town's wealth. The cannonmaker's cannonmaking rating may not be used again for thirty days minus a number of minutes equal to the total of his cannonmaking rating times 10 plus the rating of the town's armory structure times 3. When a cannon is produced in a town with a pre-existing Armory, that Armory increases in size by 0.1 points. A cannon constitutes 100 units of cargo.

## Caravel
Caravels are ships. Each caravel can carry 500 units of cargo. Caravels will not sail with fewer than 20 crew. To build a caravel, one must have a caravelbuilding rating of at least 900 and expend 300 timber, 300 cordage, 300 pitch, 6 sails and 300 coins. The coins are added to the town's wealth. The builder may not use his caravelbuilding skill again for twenty days minus 3 minutes times the total of his caravelbuilding skill and the town's shipyard structure rating. One's first caravel is free of maintenance attrition. Additional caravels deteriorate by one-tenth of one percent each day.

## Cardinal
Cardinals elect the Pope. They are appointed by the Pope. The price of a cardinal's hat is 20,000 coins minus ten coins for every point of piety (up to 1,000) held by the appointee. The appointee must have at least the same number of coins left after paying for the appointment. Cardinals gain 0.5 prestige per day.

## Cargo
In overland movement, each horse is able to carry four units of cargo. Cannons count as 100 units of cargo, falconets as 3, barques as 301, caravels as 906, galliots as 600, galleys as 3,000 and roundships as 1,812. Troops, crew, slaves, servants, cattle and sheep count as zero units of cargo. All other items count as one unit of cargo.

In movement by water, galleys can carry 2,000 units of cargo, galliots 300, barques 100, caravels 500 and roundships 1,000. Cannons count as 100 units of cargo, falconets as 3, heavy cavalry as 4, horses as 2 and light cavalry as 3. All other items count as one unit of cargo. Overloaded ships may not move.

## Cattle
Cattle may be used to satisfy a town's demand for food. They move by land without requiring transport. Each character may hold one hundred cattle without having to maintain them. Additional cattle require 0.1 units of grain per day as maintenance. Unmaintained additional cattle suffer one percent attrition per day.

## Challenge
Any male over 15 who has a dueling rating above zero may challenge to a duel any other male over 15 present at the same location. Doing so adds one point to the challenger's prestige and ties up his dueling skill for 7 days.

## Characters
Each player controls one, or more, characters belonging to one family. To activate an additional character for his family, a player must expend a number of seniority points equal to the number of characters he will have by activating that character. For example, to activate a second character, he must expend two seniority points. To activate a fourth character, he would have to expend four seniority points. 

## Citizenship
Being the citizen of a town entitles one to buy, or sell, an extra 1,000 units of trade goods in one action at that town.
A character may hold citizenship in only one town at a time.
If he qualifies, he may request that the magistrate of a town allow him to change his citizenship to that of the magistrate's town. 
There are two ways to qualify.
The first is to have at least 10,000 points of loyalty at the town.
The second is to own a domicile at the town that is at least 1,000 points in size and no less than half the size of the largest domicile at the town.
The magistrate's decision is final, but the request may be renewed at any time.

## Commander
The local commander for a League is the first of the following present at the location: the Head of the League, next his Marshal, then his Constable.

## Conspicuous consumption
A hereditary title may be acquired through the expenditure of three million coins for conspicuous consumption. The new title will have the form: Lord of X, with X being determined through consultation with the Gamemaster.

## Court officer
Any holder of a hereditary, episcopal or elective title -- other than a magistracy -- may appoint court officers as a suzerain. Holders of multiple titles may appoint court officers for each of their titles, but they may not appoint court officers to the same court office under different suzerain titles. Court officers receive 25 coins per day in pay from their appointive suzerain. Suzerains gain one point of prestige per day per court officer. Suzerains also gain 0.1 initiatives per day per Court Officer. 

Court officers hold court office assets separately from their personal assets. A court officer's assets are always in one location. This location may, or may not, be the same as that of the holder of the court office. They may be used only when they are at the same location as the court officer. Court Officer assets may be freely transferred to their suzerain. Some court officers may transfer certain assets to certain other court officers. Court office assets always fight on the same side as their court officer. Maintenance of court office assets is done separately from that of a character's personal assets, but is done in the same way. Appointing a court officer ties up the appointer's administrative skill for 48 hours minus a number of minutes equal to his administrative rating. A character may hold only one Court Office at a time. A list of court offices appears lower in the help index. Information on individual offices may be obtained by clicking on the appropriate office.

The only Court Officer eligible to receive ships, or falconets as transfers is the Admiral.
The only Court Officers eligible to receive troops as transfers are the Admiral, the Constable and the Marshal.
The only Court Officers eligible to receive cannons as transfers are the Constable and the Marshal.
The only Court Officers eligible to receive grain or transport units as transfers are the Grand Equerry, the Court Chamberlain, the Admiral, the Constable and the Marshal.
The only Court Officer eligible to receive mercury, sulfur, saltpeter, or charcoal is the Court Alchemist.
The only Court Officers eligible to receive copper are the Court Alchemist and the Master of the Court Mint.
The only Court Officer eligible to receive gold or silver is the Master of the Court Mint.
The only Court Officers eligible to receive construction materials are the Court Architect and Master of Defenses.
Other types of goods may not be transferred to any Court Officer.

## Crew
Ships may not move without the required number of crew. Barques require 10 crew, galliots require 20, galleys 100, caravels 20 and roundships 50. To recruit crew, one must expend 20 coins per recruit. Each character may hold 200 crew free of maintenance. Any additional crew require 0.1 units of grain per day in maintenance. If unmaintained, these excess crew suffer one percent attrition per day. Crew do not fight in land battles. 

## Death
When a character's health level reaches zero, he dies. The personal assets of a dead character cease to exist. His Court Office assets continue to exist at their final location until they are picked up by his successor, or subjected to destructive attack. Hereditary titles are passed on to his heir. So are banker loan rights and liabilities.

## Demand
Each town has a demand for certain categories of goods. This demand can be satisfied by selling goods to the town that fall within the categories in demand, but are of types not shown to be produced by the town. Payment for these goods is extracted from the town's wealth. A town will not buy goods for which it cannot pay. 

During the daily update, demand is increased by the incremental rate indicated in the town data multiplied by the town's population. In addition, the price offered for goods whose demand is at zero is reduced by one-tenth of one percent. When the demand for a category of goods is greater than the town's population times 334 times the listed incremental rate, the price paid is increased by one-tenth of one percent and the town's population is reduced by one plus one-tenth of one percent of the town's population. When the category whose demand has been thusly unmet is food, the population reduction is four times as large.

## DFC (de facto controller)
The de facto controler -- the DFC -- of a town is the only person who may change the sovereign of the town. He may change the sovereignty to any non-honorary title in the title data table. Doing so ties up his administrative skill for 24 hours. 

The DFC of a town may transfer de facto control to the tenant of the town. Doing so ties up his administrative skill for 24 hours.

The DFC may change the method of magistrate selection. Doing so ties up his administration skill for 24 hours. To change the method of magistrate selection away from 'by election' costs the DFC's family 1,000 points of loyalty at that town.
When a town has no DFC, the tenant may claim de facto control. Doing so ties up his administration skill for 30 days.

## Doge
The Doge of Venice is elected for life by the male citizens of the city of Venice. The Doge of Genoa is elected for life by the male citizens of Genoa. To qualify for election, a candidate must vote for himself. In addition to votes actively cast, a candidate receives a number of votes equal to his politics rating divided by 1,000. Upon election, a new Doge is divested of any magistracy and any town structure headship he may hold.

## Domicile
Domiciles increase by one hundred units the maximum size of purchases one may make from, and sales one may make to, a town. Domiciles whose size is greater than 100, increase the maximum size of purchases and sales by one point for each point of the domicile's size. Domiciles deteriorate by 0.1 points each day. A domicile whose size falls below 1.0 ceases to exist. Domiciles are not considered to be town structures. Building, or enlarging, a domicile requires the expenditure of 1,000 coins and 100 construction materials of the same type. The 1,000 coins are added to the town's wealth. The increase in the size of the domicile is equal to one plus the square root of the builder's architecture rating. His architecture rating is tied up for seven days minus a number of minutes equal to his architecture rating. Ownership of domiciles may not be transferred.

## Donation
Donations to town structures enhance the structure, increase the donor's prestige and increase the town's loyalty to his family. Specific details can be found in the list of structures appearing lower in the help index.

## Dueling
A duel results when a challenge is accepted. The accepter must have a dueling rating. Results are based on the parties' dueling ratings and their choice of a preference in each of fourteen duel options. Preferences are permanent until changed by the player. They may not be changed between the acceptance of a challenge and the carrying out of the duel. Participants may lose health, and they may gain, or lose, prestige.Dueling skill is required for the issuance, or acceptance, of challenges.

## Elections
When an elective position is vacant, anyone eligible to vote for the position may initiate an election by casting the first vote. Elections generally last about thirty days. Their inception is listed in the report of events. Papal elections last thirty days. Normally, only those who voted for themselves are eligible to win. Voting for oneself constitutes an acceptance of the elective position and of the divestiture of any incompatible positions, which is done automatically during the resolution of the elective process. Characters who have been nominated in an election for magistrate, bishop or archbishop, but are unable to vote for themselves in that election, may render themselves eligible to win by formally accepting (after the election has commenced, and before it ends) their potential election. This type of acceptance ties up the characters politics skill for 30 days, and subjects him to the same divestiture rules as a regular candidate. In any election in which they cast a vote, candidates receive a number of bonus votes equal to 1/1,000 of their rating for political skill.

Elections are resolved during the first update subsequent to the scheduled termination time for the election.

## Elective Title
The Pope, the Holy Roman Emperor, archbishops, bishops, the Grandmasters of the monastic orders, the Doge of Venice, the Doge of Genoa and some magistracies are elective. 

## Epidemics
Each day, one town will be afflicted by an epidemic disease. Those present at the afflicted town on that day suffer a health loss of 0.1 points. The town itself loses one percent of its population. The population loss is reduced by a fraction equal to the size of its Hospital divided by 10,000. (Consequently, a town with a Hospital rated at 10,000 will suffer no population loss.) Troops and workers present at the town are reduced in number by one percent.

Each day, a random factor determines whether the epidemic remains in the same town, is extinguished, or moves to another town linked by road or by a water connection. At any given time, one, and only one, town will be afflicted with an epidemic.

## Episcopal title
Bishop and archbishop are episcopal titles.

## Falconet
Falconets are used in maritime battles. They may also be used to meet a town's demand for weapons. To be able to produce falconets, one must expend a total of one saltpeter, one sulfur and one charcoal plus 10 coins and one iron per falconet produced. The coins are added to the town's wealth. The maximum number of falconets one can make at one time is equal to one-tenth of the square root of one's cannonmaking rating. Coins expended to produce a falconet are added to the town's wealth. The falconet maker's cannonmaking rating may not be used again for seven days minus a number of minutes equal to the total of his cannonmaking rating plus the rating of the town's armory structure. When falconets are produced in a town with a pre-existing Armory, that Armory is increased in size by 0.1 points.

## Family
Each family's active characters are controlled by one player. Each player controls one, or more, characters who are all in the same family. When a family has a player, one, or more, of its characters are active. When a family has a character set up, but inactive, that character may be activated with the expenditure of seniority points.

## FAR (fortification against artillery)
FAR is a town's fortification against artillery. Increasing FAR requires the expenditure of 100 construction materials of one type and 1,000 coins. The coins are added to the town's wealth. The FAR increase is equal to one plus one-tenth of the square root of the fortifier's fortification rating. The town's loyalty to the fortifier's family increases by ten points.

## FAS (fortification against assault)
FAS is a town's fortification against assault. Increasing FAS requires the expenditure of 100 construction materials of one type and 1,000 coins. The coins are added to the town's wealth. The FAS increase is equal to one plus one-tenth of the square root of the fortifier's fortification rating. The town's loyalty to the fortifier's family increases by ten points. During the daily update a town's population increases by a number equal to one percent of the size of its FAS.

## Feast days
Celebrating a town's Feast Day earns the celebrator's family a loyalty increase equal to 10% of his prestige. In addition, he receives a piety increase equal to ten plus a number of points equal to 1/1,000 of the total of the size of the Church plus the Archpriest's sermonizing rating plus the attendee's churchgoing rating. The costs are the same as for attending mass. Celebrating a Feast Day ties up a character's churchgoing skill for 24 hours. A character who has attended mass may not celebrate a Feast Day during the subsequent 24 hours.

## Feudal Aid
A character present at a town over which he is sovereign may collect a feudal Aid in coins equal to 5% of the town's wealth. The funds are taken from the town's wealth. The sovereign's family loses 100 points of loyalty at the town. The sovereign's administrative skill may not be used again for seven days.

## Ferries
A ferry runs between Otranto in Italy and Acre in Palestine. Any Catholic may use it. It leaves whenever demanded and arrives 21 days after departure. Service cannot be interrupted, nor intercepted. Travel from Acre to Otranto is free to all characters and their troops. Travel from Otranto to Acre costs 1,000 coins per character and 300 coins per troop. In each direction there is a fee of 5 coins per trade good. Ships may not travel by ferry. Ferry tolls on Court Office assets must be paid with Court Office coins. Ferry tolls on personal assets must be paid with personal coins. This ferry will run at least until the end of 1499/2021.

## Feudal levy
A feudatory of a town where his family has loyalty of at least 100 can raise a feudal levy at that town. Feudal levies consist of 500 feudal levy troops with a starting morale equal to the feudatory's family's loyalty at the town. Raising a feudal levy reduces the feudatory's family's loyalty rating by 100 points. One percent of feudal levy troops go home each day. Effective August 1, 2018/1497, 2% of feudal levy troops will go home per day. Feudal levy troops require no maintenance. 

Feudal levies are recruited from the feudal estates surrounding a town. They are collected in a town, but their recruitment is not affected by, and does not affect, town populations.

## Feudatory
Feudatories may raise feudal levies. They may increase tolls. They may collect a town's accumulation of tolls. Collecting tolls ties up their administrative skill for 48 hours minus a number of minutes equal to their administrative skill rating. A feudatory may change the tenancy of the town over which he is feudatory to any non-honorary title in the title data table. Changing the tenancy away from the town's elective magistrate results in a 500-point reduction in the town's loyalty to the feudatory's family. Changing the tenant of a town ties up one's administrative skill for 24 hours. A town's feudatory may be changed by the town's sovereign. Changing a town's feudatory ties up the sovereign's administrative skill for 24 hours.

## Field battle
There are three types of field battle:
1. Field battle to force defender to return whence he came
2. Field battle to destroy defender's goods
3. Field battle to kill the defender

Each of these three types of field battle has its own help page.
To initiate a field battle, a character must have a minimum of 100 points of prestige and one initiative.
A character may not initiate a field battle against someone else in the same league.
A character conducting a naval blockade may not be engaged in field battle, nor initiate a land battle.
Initiating field battle against an ally by marriage costs 300 points in prestige.
If the attacker is the local commander for a league, all league members present at the town participate in the attack.
If the attacker is a league member, but not the local commander, he receives no support from other league members.
If the defender is a member of a league, whether or not he is the local commander, all members of the league present at the location support him.
Court Office troops present at the location participate on the side of the holder of the Court Office.
Strongpoints held by families fighting on a side reduce its losses by a number of percentage points equal to the total value of all of these strongpoints divided by 100, but never by more than 90%.

Field battles are fought in twelve rounds.
During these rounds, the attackers' military skill rating (Mi) is equal to 1/1,000th of the total of their commander's military rating plus 100. The attackers' equitation rating (Eq) is equal to 1/1,000th of the total of his equitation rating plus 100. The attackers' morale (Mo) for each troop type is equal to 1/1,000th of the weighted average of each group of troops within that type.
The defenders' military rating is equal to 1/1,000th of the total of 100 plus the highest military rating held by a defender. The defenders' equitation rating is equal to 1/1,000 of the total of 100 plus the highest equitation rating held by a defender. The defenders' morale for each troop type is equal to 1/1,000th of the weighted average of each group of troops within that type.

Round 1: The defending bowmen each kill Mi x Mo attackers. These losses are extracted from feudal levies, then auxiliaries, then pikemen, then arquebusiers, then bowmen, then light cavalry, then heavy cavalry.
Round 2: The attackers' surviving bowmen then each kill Mi x Mo attackers. These losses are extracted from feudal levies, then auxiliaries, then pikemen, then arquebusiers, then bowmen, then light cavalry, then heavy cavalry.
Round 3: The surviving defending arquebusiers then each kill Mi x Mo attackers. These losses are extracted the same way as Round 1 losses.
Round 4: The surviving attacking arquebusiers then each kill Mi x Mo defenders. These losses are extracted the same way as Round 2 losses.
Round 5: The surviving defending light cavalry kill 3 x Mo x Mi x Eq attackers. Losses are extracted from feudal levies, then auxiliaries, then arquebusiers, then bowmen, then light cavalry. Pikemen and heavy cavalry are unaffected.
Round 6: The surviving attacking light cavalry kill 3 x Mo x MI x Eq defenders. Losses are extracted from feudal levies, then auxiliaries, then arquebusiers, then bowmen, then light cavalry. Pikemen and heavy cavalry are unaffected.
Round 7: The surviving defending heavy cavalry kill 6 x Mo x Mi x Eq attackers. Losses are extracted from feudal levies, then auxiliaries, then arquebusiers, then bowmen, then light cavalry, then heavy cavalry. Pikemen are unaffected.
Round 8: The surviving attacking heavy cavalry kill 6 x Mo x Mi x Eq defenders. Losses are extracted from feudal levies, then auxiliaries, then arquebusiers, then bowmen, then light cavalry, then heavy cavalry. Pikemen are unaffected.
Round 9: The surviving defending infantry kill Mi x Mo attackers, but feudal levies kill at half that rate. Losses are extracted from feudal levies, then auxiliaries, then pikemen, then arquebusiers, then bowmen. Cavalry are unaffected.
Round 10: The surviving attacking infantry kill Mi x Mo defenders, but feudal levies kill at half that rate. Losses are extracted from feudal levies, then auxiliaries, then pikemen, then arquebusiers, then bowmen. Cavalry are unaffected.
Round 11: Surviving defending pikemen kill Mo x Mi attackers. Losses are extracted from feudal levies, then auxiliaries, then pikemen, then arquebusiers, then bowmen, then light cavalry, then heavy cavalry.
Round 12: Surviving attacking pikemen kill Mo x Mi defenders. Losses are extracted from feudal levies, then auxiliaries, then pikemen, then arquebusiers, then bowmen, then light cavalry, then heavy cavalry.

During all rounds except the general infantry rounds (rounds 9 and 10), the troop type with the terrain advantage inflicts double the casualties it would normally inflict. Heavy cavalry have the advantage on plains, light cavalry in deserts, pikemen in hills, auxiliaries in mountains, archers in swamps and arquebusiers in forests.

All participants in the battle share troop losses in proportion to their contribution by troop type.
Morale changes are equal to 1/10th of the difference in total kills extracted.
The named defender and the attackers' commander each suffer health loss equal to 1/1,000th of the number of troops lost by his side.
Only the named defender can be forced to leave town, be despoiled of his goods, or killed outright.
A very feeble attack commander, or named defender, may die as a result of loss of health.
The military skill of the attackers' commander and of the named defender increase by one point plus 1/100th of the number of troops lost by his side.
The equitation skill of the attackers' commander and of the named defender increase by one point plus 1/100th of the number of cavalry lost by his side.

## Field battle to force defender to return whence he came
This type of field battle is fought under the general rules for field battles.
To force the named defender to retreat to his prior location, the attackers must end the battle with more land troops than the defenders and the attackers must have suffered no more losses than the defenders.

## Field battle to destroy defender's goods
This type of field battle is fought under the general rules for field battles.
To destroy the defender's goods, the attackers must end the battle with at least ten times as many land troops as the defenders and the attackers must have suffered no more losses than the defenders.

## Field battle to kill the defender
This type of field battle is fought under the general rules for field battles. Should the defender end the battle with zero land troops, he dies and the attacker loses 500 points of prestige. Should the defender end the battle with any land troops, he does not die, and the attacker does not lose the 500 points of prestige he would lose had he succeeded in killing his victim.

## Free playership
Free playership entitles a player to engage in all of the activities available under a regular playership save for three exceptions: the issuance of battle orders, membership in a league and the activation of extra characters.

## Galley
Galleys are ships. Each galley can carry 2,000 units of cargo. A galley will not sail with fewer than 100 crew. To build a galley, one must have a galleybuilding rating of at least 1,000 and expend 1,000 timber, 1,000 slaves, 1,000 pitch and 1,000 coins. The coins are added to the town's wealth. The builder may not use his galleybuilding skill again for fifty days minus 5 minutes times the total of his galleybuilding skill and the town's shipyard structure rating. One's first galley is free of maintenance attrition. Additional galleys deteriorate by one-tenth of one percent each day.

## Galliot
Galliots are ships. Each galliot can carry 300 units of cargo. Galliots will not sail with fewer than 20 crew. To build a galliot, one must have a galliotbuilding rating of at least 900 and expend 200 timber, 200 slaves, 200 pitch and 200 coins. The coins are added to the town's wealth. The builder may not use his galliotbuilding skill again for twenty days minus 3 minutes times the total of his galliotbuilding skill and the town's shipyard structure rating. One's first galliot is free of maintenance attrition. Additional galliots deteriorate by one-tenth of one percent each day.

## Gamemaster
The gamemaster (gm) administers the game. He will, from time to time, add characters, locations, strongpoints, domiciles, mobile assets and loyalties to those already in the data base. He strongly believes that, in an established game where players have vested interests in the status quo, rules should be changed only in cases of dire necessity. While this game is young, however, he will be making changes more freely where he feels they can enhance the game's playability, or historicity.

## Garrison troops
Town garrison troops defend towns against assault. Strongpoint garrison troops defend strongpoints against assault. Both suffer daily attrition equal to one-tenth of one percent. Transferring troops to a town garrison earns a family one-tenth of a point of loyalty per troop. Anyone may transfer troops to a town garrison. Only members of the owning family may transfer troops to a strongpoint. Neither crew nor feudal levy troops may be converted to garrison troops. Once troops have been transferred to a garrison, they may not be transferred back. The transfer of troops to garrisons may not be made until one has been at a location for at least 24 hours.

## Give trade goods to the townspeople to earn loyalty
Giving trade goods to the townspeople earns the donor one point of loyalty per fifty trade goods donated. Trade goods of a type produced by the town may not be used for this purpose. To dump locally produced goods, use the order to 'Abandon Trade Goods'.

## Goats
Goats may be used to satisfy a town's demand for food. They move by land without requiring transport. Each character may hold one hundred goats without having to maintain them. Additional goats require 0.2 units of grain per day as maintenance. Unmaintained additional goats suffer one percent attrition per day.

## Gonfaloniere
The position of Gonfaloniere of Florence is vacated each year on October 1. The position may then be filled by an election that lasts ten days from the date of the casting of the first vote. The Gonfaloniere is elected by the male citizens of the city of Florence. To qualify for election, a candidate must vote for himself. In addition to votes actively cast, a candidate receives a number of votes equal to his politics rating divided by 1,000.

## Grandmaster of the Knights of Rhodes
The Grandmaster of the Knights of Rhodes appoints commanders for Commandery structures from among members of the monastic order of the Knights of Rhodes. He has the sole power to admit new members to the Order. They must be Catholic, male and tonsured. He is elected to a life-term by the members of the order. In addition to votes actively cast by members, each candidate is given a number of votes equal to his prestige rating divided by 1,000.

## Grandmasters of other monastic orders
The Grandmasters of non-military monastic orders appoint abbots and abbesses for abbeys and convents belonging to their order. They are elected to life-terms by the male members of their order. In addition to votes actively cast by members, each candidate is given a number of votes equal to his reputation for piety divided by 1,000.

## Health
When a character's actual health rating reaches zero, he dies. At birth, maximum health and actual health are rated at 100. Maximum health and actual health diminish by one point each year. Actual health can also be reduced through combat, dueling, poisoning, epidemics, hunting or assassination. Actual health can be improved through herbalism, but it can never be raised above a character's maximum health rating.

## Heavy cavalry
To recruit heavy cavalry, one must expend 200 coins, four horses and one unit of armor per recruit. Each character may hold 20 heavy cavalry free of maintenance. Any additional heavy cavalry require 0.4 units of grain per day in maintenance. If unmaintained, this excess heavy cavalry suffers one percent attrition per day. Heavy cavalry fight best in plains.

## Herb
At each town, one type of herb is available for collection. Only females may collect herbs. The number of herbs collected in one action is equal to one plus one percent of the collector's herbalism rating. Herbs may be used to meet a town's demand for herbs. 

Females may use herbalism skill to improve a character's actual health. In one action, increase in actual health ratings equals 0.01 plus one-tenth of the quantity of different types of herbs being used plus one four-thousandth of the herbalist's herbalism rating plus one four-thousandth of the rating of the town's hospital structure. 

When a herbalist offers to use herbs to heal someone, her herbalism rating is tied up for 5 days.

## Heir
When a character's health level reaches zero, he dies. The personal assets of a dead character cease to exist. His Court Office assets continue to exist at their final location until they are picked up by his successor, or subjected to destructive attack. Hereditary titles are passed on to his heir. So are banker loan rights and liabilities.

## Hereditary titles
Holders of hereditary titles receive daily prestige increases. They may appoint Court Officers. Sovereignty, Feudatory status, Tenancy and de facto control may rest in this type of title. When the holder of a hereditary title dies, his titles pass to his heir. A holder of multiple hereditary titles, whose family includes an active junior member who holds no hereditary title, may transfer a hereditary title to that junior family member.

## Hold court
A sovereign may hold court. Doing so ties up his administrative skill for 48 hours and increases the town's loyalty to his family by a number of points equal to one plus the square root of half of his prestige rating.

## Honorary titles
Honorary titles, such as that of Count-Palatine of the Empire, confer prestige upon their holder, but do not entitle him to appoint Court Officers. They may not be used to assign sovereignty, nor feudatory status, nor tenancy, over a town.

## Horses
Horses are used for overland transport. Each horse may carry four units of cargo. A character's first one hundred horses require no maintenance. Additional horses require 0.1 units of grain per day. Unmaintained additional horses suffer losses of one percent per day.

## Hunt
Hunting increases one's prestige by one point. It reduces actual health by 0.003 points. Hunting skill is tied up for 48 hours minus a number of minutes equal to one's hunting rating.

## Indulgences
The Pope, or the Papal Nuncio, may offer to grant indulgences for 2,500 coins. Any Catholic who accepts has his reputation for piety increase by 25 points. The payment is added directly to the Pope's purse.

## Initiative
Most actions require the expenditure of one initiative. During each daily update, each character receives a minimum of one and a maximum of seven new initiatives. The number of initiatives received is based on a character's overall rank. The higher his rank, the fewer initiatives he receives. Overall rank is the average of all of the individual rankings for that character.

A character with at least 21 points of health may exchange one point of health for one initiative. Doing so ties up his administration skill for 24 hours. A character with zero administration skill receives one point of administration skill. Health lost in this manner can be recouped through herbalism.

## Instruction
When a character instructs in a skill another member of his family, the instructor's skill is tied up for 24 hours. No acceptance by the instructee is required. 

A character may offer to instruct someone not in his family for a fixed number of coins per skill point gained. Instruction takes place upon acceptance by the instructee. The instructor's skill is tied up for 24 hours.

The instructee's skill increase is equal to 1 + 1/100th of the difference between their difference in rating times the structure multiplier. The structure multiplier is equal to 0.5 + 1/1,000 of the size of the pertinent structure. If the instructee's skill rating is below 500, the pertinent structure is the Athenaeum. If the instructee's skill rating is under 1,000 but not under 500, the pertinent structure is the Academy. If the instructee's rating is greater than, or equal to, 1,000, the pertinent structure is the University. The pertinent structure gains one point in size. 

Each town has a local skill. Anyone present at the town may study that skill. Doing so increases the student's skill by one point plus an additional number of points equal to 1/1,000 of the size of the pertinent structure -- as defined in the above paragraph. He may not study, or use, that skill again for 24 hours.

## Investment in production
A character holding the Court Office of Chancellor may increase the production rate of a type of trade goods by 0.2 percentage points with the expenditure (from his Chancellor assets) of 20,000 coins. This action increases the town's loyalty to his family by 20 points, augments by one point the size of an existing Guildhall and increases his administration skill by one point. His administration skill may not be used again for 48 hours minus one minute for each point in his administration skill rating.

## Jewelry
50 units of jewelry may be produced by expending one unit of any precious object other than jewelry plus a number of coins equal to 500 minus one-fifth of one's jeweler skill rating. The jeweler skill may not be used again for 30 days minus a number of minutes equal to the jeweler skill times six.

## Leagues
A league headed by his suzerain may be created by any Ambassador. Doing so ties up his diplomacy skill for seven days. New members may be invited by an Ambassador to join a league headed by his suzerain who is himself a member of the league. Nuncios do so for the League of the Pope. An invitation ties up the inviter's diplomacy skill for 24 hours. Invitations expire after seven days. A character who is a member of one league may not accept membership in another league until he has resigned his membership in the first league. Characters join leagues as individuals. Members of one family may belong to different leagues.

## Leaving town
Townspeople are always impressed by the arrival of high prestige individuals, and pleased to see them leave. Loyalty goes up a little each time someone leaves a town.

## Letters
Writing a positive work of letters increases the beneficiary's prestige by a number of points approximately equal to one-tenth of the square root of the writer's letters skill. It ties up his letters skill for seven days and increases the size of the town Library by one point.

Writing a negative work of letters reduces the town's loyalty to the victim family by a number approximately equal to one-tenth of the square root of the writer's letters skill. It ties up his letters skill for seven days and increases the size of the town's Library by one point.

## Light cavalry
To recruit light cavalry, one must expend 100 coins, one horse and one unit of swords per recruit. Each character may hold 200 light cavalry free of maintenance. Any additional light cavalry require 0.2 units of grain per day in maintenance. If unmaintained, this excess light cavalry suffers one percent attrition per day. Light cavalry are most effective in deserts.

## Local commander
The local commander for a League is the first of the following present at the location: the Head of the League, next his Marshal, then his Constable.

## Loyalty
Each town has the capacity to have loyalty to one, or more, families. This loyalty can be increased by holding court, strengthening fortifications, making donations to town structures, holding assizes, celebrating the Feast Day of the town's patron saint, giving trade goods to the townspeople, or by leaving the town. It can be reduced through the production of critical works of letters and through the production of forgeries impugning a family. Loyalty influences the outcome of battles, the ability to recruit troops at the location, and the willingness of merchants to trade.
A loyalty level of 10,000 entitles a character to request citizenship.
Loyalty diminishes by 0.1 points each day through normal attrition.
Giving trade goods to the townspeople earns the donor one point of loyalty per fifty trade goods donated. Effective December 1, trade goods given to a town to increase its loyalty will have to be of types not produced by the town.

## Magistrate
The magistrate of a town can collect its accumulated tariffs. Doing so ties up his administration skill for 48 hours minus a number of minutes equal to his administration skill.

The magistrate may raise, or lower, the town's tariffs by one percentage point at a time. Each tariff change costs his family 20 points of loyalty at that town. Changing a tariff ties up his administration skill for seven days minus a number of minutes equal to 3.5 times his administration skill. 

The magistrate appoints the heads of the following town structures: the Shipyard, Academy, Athenaeum, Library, Gallery, Odeon, Guild Hall, Armory, Almshouse, Town Mint and the Bank. All appointees must be male. Appointing a structure head ties up the magistrate's administration skill for 24 hours minus a number of minutes equal to his administration rating. A Magistrate receives a bonus of 0.1 initiatives per day for each structure in his town with a head. 

Magistrates can be selected by appointment, or by election. The method of selection is indicated in the town data. Appointed magistrates serve until replaced. Offering a magistrate appointment ties up the offerer's administration skill for a period of 250 hours minus 7.5 minutes per point of administration skill held by the offerer. The term of office of an elected magistrate ends on October 1. All male citizens of the town present at the town are eligible to vote. In addition to votes cast by citizens, each candidate receives a number of votes equal to his prestige divided by 1000 plus an additional number of votes equal to his politics skill divided by 1,000. To qualify for election, a candidate must vote for himself. Upon election, a new magistrate is divested of any other magistracy he may hold.

No character may hold more than one magistracy at a time.

A town's method of magistrate selection can be changed by the de facto controller.

## Maintenance
ertain assets must be maintained daily. This maintenance is extracted automatically during the daily update. When the materials needed for maintenance are not held by the character, the affected asset automatically suffers maintenance attrition. It is up to the player to have the necessary materials on hand, or not (if he prefers to sustain the maintenance attrition). These maintainable assets include troops, crew, slaves, servants, horses, goats and cattle. Assets -- other than ships -- that are not fully maintained suffer maintenance attrition at the rate of one percent per day. A character's first 20 heavy cavalry require no maintenance, nor do his first one hundred cattle and horses, nor do his first 200 light cavalry, bowmen, pikemen, arquebusiers, auxiliaries, slaves and crew. Additional heavy cavalry require 0.4 units of grain each per day. Additional light cavalry, bowmen, pikemen and arquebusiers require 0.2 units of grain each per day. Additional auxiliaries,crew, horses, camels, cattle, goats and sheep require 0.1 units of grain each per day. Additional slaves require 0.04 units of grain each per day. When any of the above units are insufficiently maintained, they suffer one percent attrition per day. When a character has insufficient grain to support all of his assets, available grain is applied first to troops, then horses, then other animals.

Feudal levies require no maintenance, but suffer one percent attrition every day.

A character may hold one of each type of ship free of attrition. Additional ships suffer daily attrition of one-tenth of one percent.

Domiciles, town structures and strongpoints are reduced in size by 0.1 points per day. When they fall below 1.0 in size, they cease to exist.

Road patrols and strongpoint garrisons are reduced in size by 1/1,000 each day.

All servants require 0.1 coins maintenance per day. One percent of all unmaintained servants disappear.

Maximum health diminishes by 1/365 of one point per day.

## Marriage
An unmarried, untonsured male may make an offer of marriage at a town of which he is a citizen. The offer expires at the earlier of 30 days, or the date of his departure from the town. The female accepting the offer must be unmarried and untonsured. If the offer is accepted, the wedding takes place, at the site of the offer, 60 days after the date of the offer. For the wedding to take place, both must be present at the the site of the offer 60 days after the date of the offer. Both must be unmarried and untonsured at the time of the wedding. Everyone present at the town is assumed to be at the wedding. The value of the wedding is deemed to be 1/100 of the sum of the prestige of the attendees. Each attendee receives a prestige increase equal to the value of the wedding. The bride and groom receive double increases. Their two families enter into a marriage alliance.

The effects of a wedding are calculated during, and based on the situation at, the time of the first update after the ceremony.

## Marriage alliances
When two families are in a marriage alliance, should a member of either family issue battle orders against a member of the other family, or against a strongpoint owned by that family, or against a town de facto control of which is held by that family, the character issuing the battle orders suffers a loss of 300 points of prestige. Should he have fewer than 300 points of prestige, his troops will refuse to follow him into battle and the battle orders will fail.

## Mass
A Catholic present at a town with a church may attend mass. To do so, he must contribute a number of coins equal to one percent of his prestige. His reputation for piety increases by a number of points equal to 1/1,000 of the total of the size of the Church plus the Archpriest's sermonizing rating plus the attendee's churchgoing rating. Mass may not be attended more than once every 24 hours.

## Mining
In towns that sell metals other than steel, brass or bronze, mining skill can be used to produce metal trade goods. One unit of metal can be produced per ten points of mining skill. Mining skill may be used no more than once per 14 days.

## Mintage
Gold, silver and copper can be made into coins at a Town Mint. The number of coins produced is a function of the metal used and of the Minting Multiple. The Minting Multiple is equal to 1/4,000 of the total of the value of the town mint plus the minter's mintage rating plus one. Minting a unit of copper creates a number of coins equal to five plus five times the Minting Multiple. Minting a unit of silver creates a number of coins equal to 16 plus 16 times the Minting Multiple. Minting a unit of gold creates a number of coins equal to 50 plus 50 times the Minting Multiple. Town Mints increase by one point each time they are used for minting. A minter's mintage skill may not be used again for seven days.To be able to mint coins, a character must hold the Court Office of Master of the Court MintMintage skill is required to qualify for the positions of Master of the Town Mint and Master of the Court Mint. It determines the efficiency of minting.

## Miniatures
One miniature may be produced for each full hundred points in one's painting skill. Regardless of the number of miniatures produced, the process ties up the painter's skill for seven days. Each miniature is a trade good falling into the category of art. If miniatures are produced in a town with a pre-existing Gallery, the Gallery is increased in size by 0.1 points.

## Monastic order
To join a monastic order, one must be tonsured. Only the head of the order may admit new members. The head of each order is elected for life by the membership of that order. To be apointed to head a Commandery, one must be a member of the Knights of St. John. To be appointed to head an Abbey, or a Convent, which belongs to an order, one must be a member of the order to which it belongs.

## Morale
Morale determines the ability of troops to fight. It can be enhanced through sermonizing, the giving of alcohol to troops, and through the payment of bonuses. It fluctuates with the results of combat. The payment of coin bonuses to troops increases the morale of one troop by one point for each coin expended. During the daily update, as well as at the start of battles, morale ratings over 3,000 are reduced to 3,000.

The morale of Court Office troops may be increased through the payment of coin bonuses (with coins held as Court Office assets), but not through sermonizing or the provision of alcohol.

## Movement by land
Land movement is from town to town along roads. Horses and camels may each carry four units of cargo. Slaves may carry one unit of cargo. Cannons constitute 100 units of cargo. Falconets constitute three units of cargo. Trade goods are one unit of cargo. Cattle, sheep, goats, slaves, servants, troops, crew, horses and camels walk on their own. The basic movement rate for a character not accompanied by foot traffic is six. For everyone else, it is three. Speed, in leagues per hour, is equal to the basic movement rate plus the character's travel skill times the basic movement rate divided by 10,000. (S=BMR+(T/10,000)*BMR) The toll due is equal to the number of units of cargo times the average toll rate for the two towns between which the road runs. No toll is due when the road patrol has fewer troops than does the character moving along the road. Court Officers never pay tolls on their Court Office assets. Court Office troops do not enter into the road patrol calculation that determines whether a toll is due. Once arrived in a town, a character may not move again for 24 hours. Leaving a town cancels all outstanding offers made by, or to, the leaver.

## Movement by water
Water movement can be along coasts, or rivers, or into open sea zones, or out of open sea zones. Barques are not allowed into open sea zones. Roundships are not allowed to sail along rivers. Barques may carry 100 units of cargo. Galliots may carry 300. Caravels may carry 500. Roundships may carry 1,000. Galleys may carry 2,000. In water movement, cannons count as 100 units of cargo, falconets as three, light cavalry as three, horses as two, heavy cavalry as four, crew and troops count as one, and all other trade goods count as one unit of cargo. Speed is doubled when a fleet includes no galleys, barques or galliots. Galleys require 100 crew. Galliots and caravels require 20. Roundships require 50. Barques require 10. Overloaded ships may not move.

In movement by water, basic speed is four leagues per hour. When barques, galliots or galleys are included, basic speed is two leagues per hour. In both cases, effective speed is equal to basic speed multiplied by navigation skill divided by 1,000. 

## Naval battle
A naval battle takes place when a naval blockade is traversed by someone not belonging to the same League, or family, as the blockader. Naval battles occur in stages. In the first stage, falconets are fired. Three falconets may be fired per galley, two per roundship, one per caravel and one per galliot. Each fired falconet kills a number of enemy troops equal to 100 x N x G, with N being the firer's navigation rating divided by 1,000 and G being the firer's gunnery rating divided by 1,000. Losses are apportioned proportionately among all troop types. (Crew are treated as troops in all aspects of naval battle.) In the next stage, galleys belonging to the combatant with the higher navigation rating ram opposing vessels. Each ramming galley destroys a number of enemy ships equal 1/1,000 of the difference in navigation ratings between the two combatants. Ship losses are apportioned proportionately among the ship types on the rammed side. Should the destruction of shipping leave one side with insufficient capacity to hold all of its troops, the excess troops are lost. In the next stage, each bowman kills a number of opposing troops equal to his commander's navigation rating divided by 1,000 multiplied by the bowmen's morale divided by 1,000. In the next stage, arquebusiers each kill at half the rate of bowmen. The final stage is a melee in which each troop kills a number of enemies equal to 0.3 x Mi/1,000 x N/1,000 x Mo/1,000 (with Mi being military skill and Mo being the weighted average morale for all troops on the killer's side.) After the battle, if the blockade-runner has at least one troop and one ship remaining, he continues on to his destination. Should either participant end up with no troops, or no ships, he ends up in the port town where the battle took place, still in possession of his coins but without his trade goods or troops. If the blockader survives the battle with at least one ship and one troop, the blockade continues. (Naval blockades, however, are terminated during the daily update when the blockader has insufficient crew to man his ships.) Morale is adjusted after the battle. The side that suffered the fewer losses gains a number of morale points equal to 10% of the difference in losses. The other side loses the same number of points. Troops with morale of zero, or less, desert during the next daily update. The maximum morale allowed in naval battles is 3,000. Participants in a naval battle gain two points of navigation skill and one point of military skill. If they fire falconets, they also gain one point of gunnery skill.

## Nuncio
Nuncios are Papal appointees who perform the functions of Ambassadors. They are not Court Officers. They may vote in the election of bishops and archbishops. To be eligible for appointment, they must have a piety rating of at least 500 and be tonsured males. Nuncios gain 0.4 prestige per day. When appointing a Nuncio, the Pope may indicate that he is replacing a specific existing Nuncio -- thereby removing him from this office.

## Offer
Transactions between different families generally take the form of an offer made to all at the location. It is executed when accepted. It expires when the offerer leaves the town where it was issued. There is a base price for each type of good at each location. The player may offer his goods for sale at that price, for 10% more, or for 10% less. The maximum number of coins that may change hands in one transaction of this type is equal to 1,000 plus the seller's merchantry rating plus his banking rating plus the town's Guildhall rating. Sales may not take place in water zones.

## Painting
A painting may be produced at a cost of 1,000 coins minus one coin per point of painting skill, but not less than zero coins. Producing a painting ties up one's painting skill for 90 days minus a number of minutes equal to the total of the town's Gallery size times 5 plus the painter's painting skill times 50, but not less than 15 days. When a painting is produced, the town's Gallery increases in size by one point. Paintings may be donated to Galleries. Donating a painting to a Gallery increases the Gallery's size by two, the donor's prestige by two and the town's loyalty to the donor's family by ten.Painting skill is used to produce paintings, or miniatures. It is required for the positions of Curator of a Gallery and Court Painter.

## Piety
Reputation for piety increases through pilgrimage, attendance at mass and the veneration of relics. It plays a role in obtaining ecclesiastical offices.

## Pike
Pikes are used to equip pikemen. They may also be used to meet a town's demand for weapons. Pikes may be produced through the expenditure of a total of one one unit of timber and one unit of iron plus one coin per pike. Coins expended to produce pike are added to the town's wealth. In one action, a character may produce a number of pikes equal to half the square root of his smithery rating. His smithery rating may not be used again for three days minus a number of minutes equal to the total of his smithery rating plus the rating of the town's armory structure. When pikes are produced in a town with a pre-existing Armory, that Armory is increased in size by 0.1 points.

## Pikemen
To recruit pikemen, one must expend 50 coins and one pike per recruit. Each character may hold 200 pikemen free of maintenance. Any additional pikemen require 0.2 units of grain per day in maintenance. If unmaintained, these excess pikemen suffer one percent attrition per day. Pikemen fight most effectively in hill terrain.

## Pilgrimage
Italy has nine Catholic pilgrimage sites. Each one has a specific day of the year favored by pilgrims. Any Catholic present at one of these sites on its day may 'complete a pilgrimage'. Completed pilgrimages earn the pilgrim 100 points of piety and 100 points of pilgrimage skill. No more than one pilgrimage may be completed per 367 days. The pilgrimage sites (and their day) are Amalfi (November 30), Assisi (August 12), Bari (December 6), Loreto (December 10), Lucca (May 3), Milan (September 17), Naples (September 19), Rome (June 29) and Siena (April 29).

Palestine has three additional Catholic pilgrimage sites, each worth 300 points of piety. They are Jerusalem (March 18), Nazareth (July 22) and Bethlehem (August 18).

## Plunder
An individual may order his troops to assault a town for the purpose of taking plunder. Assault orders are executed 72 hours after they are initiated. In assaults only auxiliaries climb the walls. They are supported by suppressing fire from the attacker's bowmen and arquebusiers. Cavalry, pikemen and feudal levies do not participate directly in assault. When all defending garrison troops are killed, the character ordering the assault receives all of the funds in the town that have been set aside for taxes, tithes, tolls, tariffs and amercements.
An assault starts with the infliction of casualties upon the assaulting auxiliaries by the defending garrison troops. Each garrison troop kills a number of auxiliaries equal to ((N-B-Q) x FAS/1000)/1000. (N=the town's total loyalty to all families minus twice the town's loyalty to the asssaulter's family. B=the attacker's number of bowmen times their morale divided by 3,000. Q=the attacker's number of arquebusiers times their morale divided by 3,000. FAS=the town's Fortification Against Assault. If N-B-Q is calculated to be less than 100, then N-B-Q is deemed to be 100.) The assaulter's surviving auxiliaries each kill the defending garrison troops according to the following formula: M/1000 x (Mi/1000+S/1000). (M=the auxiliaries' morale. Mi=the assaulter's military rating. S=the size of the assaulter's strongpoing, if any, at the location being assault.) 
Should any garrison troops survive, no plunder is obtained.
Succeeding in plundering a town does not give the plunderer de facto control. Morale changes are equal to 1/10th of the difference in total kills extracted.

## Poison
Females with poison ratings may poison others at their location. To do so, they must expend a number of coins equal to ten times the victim's prestige rating. The victim's loss of actual health is equal to one one-hundred-and-fiftieth of the poisoner's poison rating minus the total of the victim's poison rating plus the town's Hospital structure size. (Health Loss = (poisoner poison rating - victim poison rating - hospital size)/150). Lost actual health that does not cause death can be regained through herbalism. Poison skill may not be used more than once each thirty days. If the victim's health rating is at, or below, zero at the time of the next daily update, he dies. Poison skill determines the effectiveness of poisoning attempts. Defensively, it offsets a poisoner's poisoning skill.

## Pope
The Pope is elected for life by the College of Cardinals.
The Pope appoints Apostolic Protonotaries, Nuncios and Cardinals. Making one of these appointments ties up his administration skill for ten days. Holders of Papal Offices receive 0.1 prestige per day. Nuncios receive an additional 0.4 prestige per day. Cardinals receive an additional 0.5 prestige per day.
The Pope serves as Bishop of Rome. He plays a role in the selection of all bishops and archbishops. He receives Annates from new bishops and archbishops. He may excommunicate Catholics. He is sovereign over the Papal States and Avignon and may appoint Court Officers as a Suzerain. Whenever the papacy is vacant, an election may be initiated by any cardinal by casting a vote while in Rome. Any Cardinal present at Rome is eligible to vote. The election ends thirty days after the casting of the first vote. Upon election, a new Pope is immediately divested of all non-hereditary positions he holds. In the election, in addition to the votes actively cast by Cardinals, each candidate receives a number of votes equal to his reputation for piety divided by 1,000.

## Population
During each daily update, all populations are increased by one. The populations of those towns whose wealth is greater than average increase by one plus 1/1,000 of the current population. The population of each town possessing the largest town structure of its type increases by one each day. Population also increases by a number equal to one percent of the sum of the sizes of all of the town's structures plus its FAS. Population declines at the end of each day on which a town's demand for a category of goods is greater than 334 times the town's population times the town's listed incremental rate for that category of goods. The rate of decline is .0003 times the population per day per unsatisfied category. Population loss is quadrupled when the unsatisfied demand category is food. Population can also decline due to epidemics, or military activity.

## Prestige
Prestige is one of the factors that enters into the calculation of rank.

When a character leaves a town at which loyalty to his family is greater than zero, the townspeople's loyalty to his family increases by a number of points equal to one percent of his prestige.

The ten characters with the highest prestige attract volunteer heavy cavalry each day. The number of these free heavy cavalry ranges from 1.0 for the highest prestige to 0.1 heavy cavalry for the tenth highest prestige. Characters with no heavy cavalry receive no free heavy cavalry. Free heavy cavalry are subject to the same rules for maintenance and attrition as are recruited heavy cavalry. 

Titled characters receive a daily increase in their prestige ranging from 0.1 points for lords/signori, to 0.4 points for counts, 0.5 for marquises, 0.6 for dukes and 1.0 points for the Pope.

## Production
Each town produces up to ten types of goods, which are available for purchase. Town data indicates type, category, quantity available, efficiency and workers. Efficiency is a constant that determines the number of goods produced per worker. Worker allocation is recalculated each day to move workers towards the production of those types of goods which the town is most successful in selling. The quantity available increases each day by a number equal to the population times the efficiency figure times the workers figure times 0.01.

If the quantity available at the end of the day is less than one, the price is increased by one-tenth of one percent, and the worker allocation is increased by one one-hundredth of one percent, but the daily increase in worker allocation cannot exceed one full point.

If the quantity available is greater than the worker figure times the efficiency figure times the population, price is reduced by one-tenth of one percent and the workers figure is reduced by one one-hundredth of one percent.

## Purchase
Goods produced by a town are available for purchase at that town. The maximum number of goods one can purchase in one action is equal to 100 plus one's merchantry rating plus the size of any family strongpoint at the town plus 100 for owning a domicile at the town plus 1,000 for being a citizen of the town plus one-tenth the size of the town's Guildhall. When a domicile has a value greater than 100, one additional unit may be purchased for each point by which the domicile's size exceeds 100. The export tariff is a percentage added to the price of the goods. When a purchase is made at a town with a pre-existing Guildhall, the Guildhall increases in size by 0.1 points.

## Ranking
Rankings in fourteen categories are calculated daily. Besides an overall ranking they are for: prestige, troops, shipping, coins, court office assets, total size of all strongpoints owned by the family, total size of all domiciles owned by the family, total skill points, total population controlled as a sovereign, total population controlled as a feudatory, total population controlled as a tenant and total population controlled as a DFC. Each day, the ten characters with the highest prestige attract from 1.0 to 0.1 heavy cavalry as volunteers. The highest ranking character attracts 1.0. The tenth highest attracts 0.1. The ten characters with the highest overall ranking gain from 1.0 to 0.1 points of prestige. The highest ranking gains 1.0 points of prestige. The tenth highest gains 0.1 points of prestige. Overall rank has an adverse effect on the number of initiatives a character receives each day. The highest ranking character overall receives only 0.34 new initiatives each day while the lowest ranking character receives 3.0 new initiatives.

## Recruit
Towns have a limited number of recruits available. When troops, crew or servants are engaged, their number is subtracted from the number of recruits available at the town. Each town's recruit pool increases by one each day. For each initiative expended, the number of recruits that may be recruited is equal to one plus 1/100th of the family's loyalty rating at the town.

## Regular Playership
Regular playership entitles a player to issue battle orders, participate in a league and add characters to his family. The fee for regular playership is 25 cents per day per character.

## Relics
Donating a Catholic relic to a Church increases the donor's prestige by 150, the donor's piety by 150, the size of the Church by 150 and the town's loyalty to the donor's family by 150.
Once per month, the possessor of relics may venerate them. Veneration increases the venerator's piety rating by ten points for each relic being venerated. The local Church gains one point for each relic being venerated.

## Road
Roads are the routes that must be followed to travel by land between towns. The toll rate is the number of coins that must be paid per unit of trade goods as a toll. When the character moving along a road has more personal troops than there are in the road patrol, no toll is paid. Court Officer assets are not subject to tolls. Tolls are split between the towns at the two ends of the road. Effective distance is a function of air distance, terrain and road quality. Roads deteriorate very slightly each time a horse uses them. Road quality can be improved by a Court Engineer. Combat does not take place on roads.

## Road patrol
Road patrols are necessary to enforce the payment of tolls. They suffer daily attrition equal to one-tenth of one percent. Transferring troops to a road patrol earns a family one-tenth of a point of loyalty per troop. Anyone may transfer troops to a road patrol. Once troops have been transferred to a road patrol, they may not be transferred away from the road patrol. Neither crew nor feudal levy troops may be converted to road patrol troops. Road patrols may not attack nor be attacked.

## Rock
There is no town demand for rock. Rock can be converted to construction materials by a stonemason. Each unit of rock fashioned into construction materials becomes two units of construction materials. The maximum number of units that can be converted in one action is equal to 100 plus the stonemason's stonemasonry rating. The skill may not be used again for 14 days.

## Roundship
Roundships are ships used for 'coastal' and 'sea' transport. They are not allowed to make 'river' moves. Each roundship can carry 1,000 units of cargo. Roundships will not sail with fewer than 50 crew. To build a roundship, one must have a roundshipbuilding rating of at least 1,000 and expend 600 timber, 600 cordage, 600 pitch, 12 sails and 600 coins. The coins are added to the town's wealth. The builder may not use his roundshipbuilding skill again for forty days minus 3 minutes times the total of his roundshipbuilding skill and the town's shipyard structure rating. One's first roundship is free of maintenance attrition. Additional roundships deteriorate by one-tenth of one percent each day.

## Sale
Goods may be sold to towns to meet the town's demand for goods of that category, but goods of a type produced by a town may never be sold to that town. The price received for selling goods to a town is reduced by a percentage equal to the town's import tariff rate. The maximum number of goods that may be sold to a town in one action is equal to 100 plus 100 for possessing a domicile in the town plus a number equal to the size of a strongpoint owned by the seller's family at the town plus 1,000 for being a citizen of the town plus a number equal to the seller's merchantry rating plus one-tenth of the size of the town's Guildhall. When a domicile has a value greater than 100, one additional unit may be sold for each point by which the domicile's size exceeds 100. The gross price paid out is taken from the town's wealth. If the town has insufficient wealth, the transaction must be reduced in size sufficiently to enable the town to pay the gross price. The tariff extracted from the transaction is added to the town's total accumulation of tariff money.

Any number of types of goods of a single category may be sold to a town with the expenditure of a total of one initiative. In such cases, the price received for the second type of good is 10% higher than the basic price. The price received for the third type of good is 20% higher. Each additional type of good receives a price ten percentage points more than the preceding one. The type of goods being sold in the largest quantity must be sold in the first part of the action, then the type of goods being sold in the next largest quantity, then the type of goods being sold in the third largest quantity, etc. To receive the bonus for multiple types of goods, the seller must sell all of the items as part of one action. 

When a character (in one action) sells to a town (with a pre-existing Guildhall) items of every eligible type he holds within a category, the Guildhall increases in size by 0.1 points. 

Goods may be sold to characters outside one's family. This is done through an offer followed by an acceptance. There is a base price for each type of good at each location. The player may offer his goods for sale at that price, for 10% more, or for 10% less. The maximum number of coins that may change hands in one transaction of this type is equal to 1,000 plus the seller's merchantry rating plus his banking rating plus the town's Guildhall rating. Sales may not take place in water zones.

During the daily update, should a town's demand for a category of goods be less than one, then the price offered for that category is reduced by one one-thousandth. Should the demand for a category of goods be greater than 334 times the town's population times the daily increment for that category, then the price offered is increased by one one-thousandth. The quantity of goods in a category is increased each day by a number equal to the population times the daily increment figure. 

## Sculpture
Producing a sculpture costs a number of coins equal to 2,000 minus the sculptor's sculpting rating. This rating may not be used again for 90 days minus a number of minutes equal to the total of his sculpting rating times 100 plus the town's gallery rating times 10, but the resulting figure may not be less than 30 days. The town's gallery rating increases by two points each time a sculpture is made. 

Sculptures may be donated to a Gallery. Donating a sculpture to a Gallery increases the donor's prestige by four, the Gallery's size by four and the town's loyalty to the donor's family by tewnty.

## Seniority points
A player acquires 0.067 seniority points each day on which he logs on. Seniority points enable a player to add characters to his family. To activate an additional character for his family, a player must expend a number of seniority points equal to the number of characters he will have by activating that character. For example, to activate a second character, he must expend two seniority points. To activate a fourth character, he would have to expend four seniority points.

Some families are available only by election. In playership elections, anyone with seniority points may cast ballots for himself. The number he may cast is equal to the unexpended seniority points he has accumulated. The losers of the election retain all of their seniority points. The winner expends all of his seniority points.

## Servant
Servants may be recruited for a price of ten coins each. They require daily maintenance of 0.1 coins. Unpaid servants suffer one percent attrition per day. Each day, the holder of the greatest number of servants gains 1.0 points of prestige. Characters are expected to have 0.01 servants per point of prestige. Each day, failure to have enough servants reduces their prestige by 0.001 points per missing 0.01 servants (in other words, they lose 0.1 points of prestige for each missing servant).

## Sheep
Sheep may be used to satisfy a town's demand for food. They move by land without requiring transport. Each character may hold one hundred sheep without having to maintain them. Additional sheep require 0.2 units of grain per day as maintenance. Unmaintained additional sheep suffer one percent attrition per day.

## Siege bombardment of strongpoint
Siege bombardment can be used to reduce the size of a strongpoint. Bombardment orders are executed 72 hours after they are issued. Each cannon reduces the strongpoint by a number of points equal to the bombarder's gunnery rating divided by 500. Each cannon suffers impairment of 2% each time it is used in bombardment.

## Siege bombardment of town
Siege bombardment can be used to reduce the FAS (Fortification Against Assault) of a town. Bombardment orders are executed 72 hours after they are issued. Each cannon reduces FAS by a number of points equal to 1/500th of the excess of the bombarder's gunnery rating over the town's FAR (Fortification Against Artillery). Each cannon suffers impairment of 2% each time it is used in bombardment.

## Skill
Most actions require a skill for their accomplishment. Limitations on the reuse of skills are utilized to reflect the time required to generate the original outcome. Most actions cause their performer to gain one point of the pertinent skill. Individual skills are grouped together further down in the help topic index. Skills contribute to the overall ranking of characters. There are no limits to the skill points that a character can acquire. Skills may be passed on through instruction by another character. Each town has a local skill, which may be acquired by 'studying the local skill'.

## Slaves
Slaves may be purchased at some town markets. They may also be obtained through victory in battle against enemies of a different religion. One's first 200 slaves require no maintenance. Additional slaves require 0.04 units of grain per day in maintenance. Failure to provide this maintenance results in one percent maintenance attrition per day.

When moving overland, slaves may each haul one unit of cargo.

## Sovereign
Sovereigns may hold court. Doing so increases the town's loyalty to their family by a number of points equal to one plus the square root of half of their prestige. It ties up the sovereign's administration skill for 48 hours. The sovereign's Seneschal may collect a town's accumulation of taxes. 

A sovereign may change feudatory status of a town over which he is sovereign to any non-honorary title in the title data table. Changing the feudatory away from the town's elective magistrate results in a 500-point reduction in the town's loyalty to the sovereign's family. Changing the feudatory of a town ties up one's administrative skill for 24 hours. 

A sovereign may collect an Aid in the amount of 5% of the wealth of a town. Doing so results in a reduction by 100 points of the loyalty of the town to the sovereign's family. It ties up the sovereign's administration skill for seven days minus a number of minutes equal to 3.5 times his administration skill. 

A town's sovereign may be changed by the town's de facto controller(DFC).

## Speed
In overland movement, basic speed is six leagues per hour when all units are mounted. When moving with auxiliaries, pikemen, archers, arquebusiers, feudal levies, slaves, servants, crew, cattle, or sheep, basic speed is three leagues per hour. In both cases, basic speed is increased by a percentage equal to the characters's travel skill divided by 10,000.

In movement by water, basic speed is four leagues per hour. When barques, galliots or galleys are included, basic speed is two leagues per hour. In both cases, effective speed is equal to basic speed multiplied by navigation skill divided by 1,000.

## Statuettes
One statuette may be produced for each full hundred points in one's sculpting skill. Regardless of the number of statuettes produced, the process ties up the sculptor's skill for seven days. Each statuette is a trade good falling into the category of art. When statuettes are produced in a town with a pre-existing Gallery, the Gallery increases in size by 0.1 points.

## Strongpoint
Each family may own a strongpoint at each location. Strongpoint ownership raises the overall ranking of members of the owning family. Strongpoints facilitate trade with townspeople, play a role in military activities and serve as depots for trade goods. Building, or adding to, a strongpoint requires the expenditure of 8,000 coins and 100 construction materials of one type. The strongpoint's size increase is roughly equal to the square root of the builder's fortification skill. It ties up the builder's fortification skill for seven days minus a number of minutes equal to his fortification skill.

Strongpoints may hold in storage any one type of trade good. Goods may be transferred to the strongpoint solely by members of the family that owns it. Goods may be transferred from the strongpoint solely to members of the family that owns it.

Strongpoint garrisons consist of troops transferred to the strongpoint by members of the owning family. Once transferred to the strongpoint, they lose their type identity and become ordinary strongpoint garrison troops. For example, heavy cavalry and auxiliaries both become ordinary strongpoint garrison troops. Neither feudal levy troops, nor crew, may be transferred to strongpoints. Once transferred to a strongpoint, troops may not be transferred away from the strongpoint.
Stronpoints lose 0.1 points of size per day. When they fall below 1.0 in size, they cease to exist. When a strongpoint ceases to exist, all of its contents are lost.

## Structure
Each town may have up to 18 town structures. Information about individual types of town structures can be found in a lower section of the help topic index. The head of a town structure other than a Convent must be a male. Convent heads must be female. No one may serve as head of more than one structure at a time. Each structure with a head gains 0.2 points in size per day. When the head is present at the site of the structure, this size increase is doubled to 0.4 points. A magistrate receives an extra 0.1 initiatives per day for each structure in his town with a head. 

During the daily update a town's population increases by a number equal to one percent of the sum of the sizes of its structures. Having the largest structure of its type, causes a town's population to increase by an additional one person each day. Having the most total structure points also increases a town's population by one per day. The second largest structure of each category attracts 0.9 population per day. The third largest 0.8 population, etc. Universities confer triple the normal population bonus for size.

Structures deteriorate by 0.1 points per day. When they fall below 1.0 in size, they cease to exist. Building, or expanding, a town structure requires the expenditure of 1,000 coins and 100 construction materials of one type. The size increase is roughly equal to one-tenth of the square root of the builder's architecture rating. The builder's architecture rating is tied up for seven days minus a number of minutes equal to his architecture rating. During the daily update, each town structure head receives as remuneration 1/100,000 of the town's wealth.

## Suzerain
Anyone who holds a title that is hereditary, or elective -- other than a magistracy -- may appoint court officers. An appointer of a court officer is his suzerain.

## Sword

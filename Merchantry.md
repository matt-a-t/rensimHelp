## Abandon Trade Goods
Abandoning trade goods removes them from one's assets, which (depending on the type of trade goods being abandoned) may reduce the need for transport or allow for faster movement.
## Banker Loan
The maximum number of coins a banker may lend in one loan is equal to 50 times his banking skill rating. If the town's bank structure has a lower rating than the banker's banking rating, the maximum loan he may offer is equal to 25 times the banker's banking skill rating plus 25 times the town's bank structure rating. The largest loan a character may accept is one for no more than 50 coins per point of prestige he has at the time of his acceptance. Bankers may offer loans for lesser amounts. Offering a banker loan ties up the banker's banking skill for 48 hours. A bank loan offered to a single individual from a single banker may not bring the debtor's total debt to that banker to a level greater than the banker's current maximum loan offer. During the daily update, a number of coins equal to the total debt times 0.003 is transferred from the borrower to the lender as an interest payment. A debtor who cannot make a daily interest payment loses one point of prestige that day. Debts may be paid off at any time.
## Blockade
Three types of blockades are possible: market blockades, road blockades and naval blockades. Anyone with one, or more, land troops may institute a road blockade, or a market blockade. Anyone with fully-crewed ships not overloaded with cargo may institute a naval blockade. Blockades apply to anyone who is neither a member of the blockader's family, nor a member of the same League as the blockader. When a market is blockaded, no one to whom it applies may buy goods from the townspeople, nor sell goods to the townspeople. When a road is being blockaded, no one to whom it applies may leave the town in any direction except the one whence he came. When a naval blockade has been established, anyone to whom it applies who arrives at, or leaves from, the town by water is automatically engaged in naval battle with the naval blockader. Blockades last until they are terminated by the blockader, or ended by his departure from the town. A town may have no more than one naval blockade active at any one time. Establishing a blockade ends any pre-existing blockades being conducted by the establisher of the new blockade.
## Camels
Camels are used for overland transport. Each camel may carry four units of cargo. A character's first one hundred camels require no maintenance. Additional camels require 0.2 units of grain per day. Unmaintained additional camels suffer losses of one percent per day.
## Cargo
In overland movement, each horse is able to carry four units of cargo. Cannons count as 100 units of cargo, falconets as 3, barques as 301, caravels as 906, galliots as 600, galleys as 3,000 and roundships as 1,812. Troops, crew, slaves, servants, cattle and sheep count as zero units of cargo. All other items count as one unit of cargo.

In movement by water, galleys can carry 2,000 units of cargo, galliots 300, barques 100, caravels 500 and roundships 1,000. Cannons count as 100 units of cargo, falconets as 3, heavy cavalry as 4, horses as 2 and light cavalry as 3. All other items count as one unit of cargo. Overloaded ships may not move.
## Cattle
Cattle may be used to satisfy a town's demand for food. They move by land without requiring transport. Each character may hold one hundred cattle without having to maintain them. Additional cattle require 0.1 units of grain per day as maintenance. Unmaintained additional cattle suffer one percent attrition per day.
## Demand
Each town has a demand for certain categories of goods. This demand can be satisfied by selling goods to the town that fall within the categories in demand, but are of types not shown to be produced by the town. Payment for these goods is extracted from the town's wealth. A town will not buy goods for which it cannot pay. 

During the daily update, demand is increased by the incremental rate indicated in the town data multiplied by the town's population. In addition, the price offered for goods whose demand is at zero is reduced by one-tenth of one percent. When the demand for a category of goods is greater than the town's population times 334 times the listed incremental rate, the price paid is increased by one-tenth of one percent and the town's population is reduced by one plus one-tenth of one percent of the town's population. When the category whose demand has been thusly unmet is food, the population reduction is four times as large.
## Give trade goods to the townspeople to earn loyalty
Giving trade goods to the townspeople earns the donor one point of loyalty per fifty trade goods donated. Trade goods of a type produced by the town may not be used for this purpose. To dump locally produced goods, use the order to 'Abandon Trade Goods'.

## Goats
Goats may be used to satisfy a town's demand for food. They move by land without requiring transport. Each character may hold one hundred goats without having to maintain them. Additional goats require 0.2 units of grain per day as maintenance. Unmaintained additional goats suffer one percent attrition per day.

## Horses
Horses are used for overland transport. Each horse may carry four units of cargo. A character's first one hundred horses require no maintenance. Additional horses require 0.1 units of grain per day. Unmaintained additional horses suffer losses of one percent per day.

## Jewelry
50 units of jewelry may be produced by expending one unit of any precious object other than jewelry plus a number of coins equal to 500 minus one-fifth of one's jeweler skill rating. The jeweler skill may not be used again for 30 days minus a number of minutes equal to the jeweler skill times six.

## Mining
In towns that sell metals other than steel, brass or bronze, mining skill can be used to produce metal trade goods. One unit of metal can be produced per ten points of mining skill. Mining skill may be used no more than once per 14 days.

## Mintage
Gold, silver and copper can be made into coins at a Town Mint. The number of coins produced is a function of the metal used and of the Minting Multiple. The Minting Multiple is equal to 1/4,000 of the total of the value of the town mint plus the minter's mintage rating plus one. Minting a unit of copper creates a number of coins equal to five plus five times the Minting Multiple. Minting a unit of silver creates a number of coins equal to 16 plus 16 times the Minting Multiple. Minting a unit of gold creates a number of coins equal to 50 plus 50 times the Minting Multiple. Town Mints increase by one point each time they are used for minting. A minter's mintage skill may not be used again for seven days.To be able to mint coins, a character must hold the Court Office of Master of the Court MintMintage skill is required to qualify for the positions of Master of the Town Mint and Master of the Court Mint. It determines the efficiency of minting.

## Miniatures
One miniature may be produced for each full hundred points in one's painting skill. Regardless of the number of miniatures produced, the process ties up the painter's skill for seven days. Each miniature is a trade good falling into the category of art. If miniatures are produced in a town with a pre-existing Gallery, the Gallery is increased in size by 0.1 points.

## Painting
A painting may be produced at a cost of 1,000 coins minus one coin per point of painting skill, but not less than zero coins. Producing a painting ties up one's painting skill for 90 days minus a number of minutes equal to the total of the town's Gallery size times 5 plus the painter's painting skill times 50, but not less than 15 days. When a painting is produced, the town's Gallery increases in size by one point. Paintings may be donated to Galleries. Donating a painting to a Gallery increases the Gallery's size by two, the donor's prestige by two and the town's loyalty to the donor's family by ten.Painting skill is used to produce paintings, or miniatures. It is required for the positions of Curator of a Gallery and Court Painter.
s
## Purchase
Goods produced by a town are available for purchase at that town. The maximum number of goods one can purchase in one action is equal to 100 plus one's merchantry rating plus the size of any family strongpoint at the town plus 100 for owning a domicile at the town plus 1,000 for being a citizen of the town plus one-tenth the size of the town's Guildhall. When a domicile has a value greater than 100, one additional unit may be purchased for each point by which the domicile's size exceeds 100. The export tariff is a percentage added to the price of the goods. When a purchase is made at a town with a pre-existing Guildhall, the Guildhall increases in size by 0.1 points.

## Rock
There is no town demand for rock. Rock can be converted to construction materials by a stonemason. Each unit of rock fashioned into construction materials becomes two units of construction materials. The maximum number of units that can be converted in one action is equal to 100 plus the stonemason's stonemasonry rating. The skill may not be used again for 14 days.
## Slaves
Slaves may be purchased at some town markets. They may also be obtained through victory in battle against enemies of a different religion. One's first 200 slaves require no maintenance. Additional slaves require 0.04 units of grain per day in maintenance. Failure to provide this maintenance results in one percent maintenance attrition per day.

When moving overland, slaves may each haul one unit of cargo.

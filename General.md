## Action
All acts carried out by a character constitute an Action. Most Actions entail the expenditure of an Initiative. Characters who have sufficient Initiatives may execute multiple Actions during the same day.

## Auctions
Each day an exotic trade good will be put up for auction. The type of trade good is determined through a daily vote in which each player is able to cast a number of ballots equal to his seniority vote count. This action uses no intiatives and does not expend any seniority votes. When a player casts such ballots, all characters in his family who have a rating for politics skill have one point added to their rating for this skill.

## Begging
Begging costs the beggar one point of prestige. He receives a number of coins equal to 1/100 of the town's almshouse structure rating. These coins are extracted from the town's wealth.

## Bulletin Board
Any player may make a posting to the Bulletin Board at any time. Doing so does not use up an initiative. During the daily update, each character belonging to the poster's family, and possessed of a letters rating higher than zero, receives a rating increase of 0.1 points. This rating increase may be earned once per day. Players are encouraged to post their email addresses.

## Characters
Each player controls one, or more, characters belonging to one family. To activate an additional character for his family, a player must expend a number of seniority points equal to the number of characters he will have by activating that character. For example, to activate a second character, he must expend two seniority points. To activate a fourth character, he would have to expend four seniority points. 

## Citizenship
Being the citizen of a town entitles one to buy, or sell, an extra 1,000 units of trade goods in one action at that town.
A character may hold citizenship in only one town at a time.
If he qualifies, he may request that the magistrate of a town allow him to change his citizenship to that of the magistrate's town. 
There are two ways to qualify.
The first is to have at least 10,000 points of loyalty at the town.
The second is to own a domicile at the town that is at least 1,000 points in size and no less than half the size of the largest domicile at the town.
The magistrate's decision is final, but the request may be renewed at any time.

## Conspicuous consumption
A hereditary title may be acquired through the expenditure of three million coins for conspicuous consumption. The new title will have the form: Lord of X, with X being determined through consultation with the Gamemaster.
## Death
When a character's health level reaches zero, he dies. The personal assets of a dead character cease to exist. His Court Office assets continue to exist at their final location until they are picked up by his successor, or subjected to destructive attack. Hereditary titles are passed on to his heir. So are banker loan rights and liabilities.
## Doge
The Doge of Venice is elected for life by the male citizens of the city of Venice. The Doge of Genoa is elected for life by the male citizens of Genoa. To qualify for election, a candidate must vote for himself. In addition to votes actively cast, a candidate receives a number of votes equal to his politics rating divided by 1,000. Upon election, a new Doge is divested of any magistracy and any town structure headship he may hold.
## Family
Each family's active characters are controlled by one player. Each player controls one, or more, characters who are all in the same family. When a family has a player, one, or more, of its characters are active. When a family has a character set up, but inactive, that character may be activated with the expenditure of seniority points.
## Feast days
Celebrating a town's Feast Day earns the celebrator's family a loyalty increase equal to 10% of his prestige. In addition, he receives a piety increase equal to ten plus a number of points equal to 1/1,000 of the total of the size of the Church plus the Archpriest's sermonizing rating plus the attendee's churchgoing rating. The costs are the same as for attending mass. Celebrating a Feast Day ties up a character's churchgoing skill for 24 hours. A character who has attended mass may not celebrate a Feast Day during the subsequent 24 hours.
## Ferries
A ferry runs between Otranto in Italy and Acre in Palestine. Any Catholic may use it. It leaves whenever demanded and arrives 21 days after departure. Service cannot be interrupted, nor intercepted. Travel from Acre to Otranto is free to all characters and their troops. Travel from Otranto to Acre costs 1,000 coins per character and 300 coins per troop. In each direction there is a fee of 5 coins per trade good. Ships may not travel by ferry. Ferry tolls on Court Office assets must be paid with Court Office coins. Ferry tolls on personal assets must be paid with personal coins. This ferry will run at least until the end of 1499/2021.

## Free playership
Free playership entitles a player to engage in all of the activities available under a regular playership save for three exceptions: the issuance of battle orders, membership in a league and the activation of extra characters.
## Gamemaster
The gamemaster (gm) administers the game. He will, from time to time, add characters, locations, strongpoints, domiciles, mobile assets and loyalties to those already in the data base. He strongly believes that, in an established game where players have vested interests in the status quo, rules should be changed only in cases of dire necessity. While this game is young, however, he will be making changes more freely where he feels they can enhance the game's playability, or historicity.
## Gonfaloniere
The position of Gonfaloniere of Florence is vacated each year on October 1. The position may then be filled by an election that lasts ten days from the date of the casting of the first vote. The Gonfaloniere is elected by the male citizens of the city of Florence. To qualify for election, a candidate must vote for himself. In addition to votes actively cast, a candidate receives a number of votes equal to his politics rating divided by 1,000.
## Health
When a character's actual health rating reaches zero, he dies. At birth, maximum health and actual health are rated at 100. Maximum health and actual health diminish by one point each year. Actual health can also be reduced through combat, dueling, poisoning, epidemics, hunting or assassination. Actual health can be improved through herbalism, but it can never be raised above a character's maximum health rating.

## Herb
At each town, one type of herb is available for collection. Only females may collect herbs. The number of herbs collected in one action is equal to one plus one percent of the collector's herbalism rating. Herbs may be used to meet a town's demand for herbs. 

Females may use herbalism skill to improve a character's actual health. In one action, increase in actual health ratings equals 0.01 plus one-tenth of the quantity of different types of herbs being used plus one four-thousandth of the herbalist's herbalism rating plus one four-thousandth of the rating of the town's hospital structure. 

When a herbalist offers to use herbs to heal someone, her herbalism rating is tied up for 5 days.

## Heir
When a character's health level reaches zero, he dies. The personal assets of a dead character cease to exist. His Court Office assets continue to exist at their final location until they are picked up by his successor, or subjected to destructive attack. Hereditary titles are passed on to his heir. So are banker loan rights and liabilities.

## Hereditary titles
Holders of hereditary titles receive daily prestige increases. They may appoint Court Officers. Sovereignty, Feudatory status, Tenancy and de facto control may rest in this type of title. When the holder of a hereditary title dies, his titles pass to his heir. A holder of multiple hereditary titles, whose family includes an active junior member who holds no hereditary title, may transfer a hereditary title to that junior family member.

## Honorary titles
Honorary titles, such as that of Count-Palatine of the Empire, confer prestige upon their holder, but do not entitle him to appoint Court Officers. They may not be used to assign sovereignty, nor feudatory status, nor tenancy, over a town.

## Hunt
Hunting increases one's prestige by one point. It reduces actual health by 0.003 points. Hunting skill is tied up for 48 hours minus a number of minutes equal to one's hunting rating.

## Initiative
Most actions require the expenditure of one initiative. During each daily update, each character receives a minimum of one and a maximum of seven new initiatives. The number of initiatives received is based on a character's overall rank. The higher his rank, the fewer initiatives he receives. Overall rank is the average of all of the individual rankings for that character.

A character with at least 21 points of health may exchange one point of health for one initiative. Doing so ties up his administration skill for 24 hours. A character with zero administration skill receives one point of administration skill. Health lost in this manner can be recouped through herbalism.

## Instruction
When a character instructs in a skill another member of his family, the instructor's skill is tied up for 24 hours. No acceptance by the instructee is required. 

A character may offer to instruct someone not in his family for a fixed number of coins per skill point gained. Instruction takes place upon acceptance by the instructee. The instructor's skill is tied up for 24 hours.

The instructee's skill increase is equal to 1 + 1/100th of the difference between their difference in rating times the structure multiplier. The structure multiplier is equal to 0.5 + 1/1,000 of the size of the pertinent structure. If the instructee's skill rating is below 500, the pertinent structure is the Athenaeum. If the instructee's skill rating is under 1,000 but not under 500, the pertinent structure is the Academy. If the instructee's rating is greater than, or equal to, 1,000, the pertinent structure is the University. The pertinent structure gains one point in size. 

Each town has a local skill. Anyone present at the town may study that skill. Doing so increases the student's skill by one point plus an additional number of points equal to 1/1,000 of the size of the pertinent structure -- as defined in the above paragraph. He may not study, or use, that skill again for 24 hours.

## Leagues
A league headed by his suzerain may be created by any Ambassador. Doing so ties up his diplomacy skill for seven days. New members may be invited by an Ambassador to join a league headed by his suzerain who is himself a member of the league. Nuncios do so for the League of the Pope. An invitation ties up the inviter's diplomacy skill for 24 hours. Invitations expire after seven days. A character who is a member of one league may not accept membership in another league until he has resigned his membership in the first league. Characters join leagues as individuals. Members of one family may belong to different leagues.

## Leaving town
Townspeople are always impressed by the arrival of high prestige individuals, and pleased to see them leave. Loyalty goes up a little each time someone leaves a town.

## Letters
Writing a positive work of letters increases the beneficiary's prestige by a number of points approximately equal to one-tenth of the square root of the writer's letters skill. It ties up his letters skill for seven days and increases the size of the town Library by one point.

Writing a negative work of letters reduces the town's loyalty to the victim family by a number approximately equal to one-tenth of the square root of the writer's letters skill. It ties up his letters skill for seven days and increases the size of the town's Library by one point.
## Maintenance
Certain assets must be maintained daily. This maintenance is extracted automatically during the daily update. When the materials needed for maintenance are not held by the character, the affected asset automatically suffers maintenance attrition. It is up to the player to have the necessary materials on hand, or not (if he prefers to sustain the maintenance attrition). These maintainable assets include troops, crew, slaves, servants, horses, goats and cattle. Assets -- other than ships -- that are not fully maintained suffer maintenance attrition at the rate of one percent per day. A character's first 20 heavy cavalry require no maintenance, nor do his first one hundred cattle and horses, nor do his first 200 light cavalry, bowmen, pikemen, arquebusiers, auxiliaries, slaves and crew. Additional heavy cavalry require 0.4 units of grain each per day. Additional light cavalry, bowmen, pikemen and arquebusiers require 0.2 units of grain each per day. Additional auxiliaries,crew, horses, camels, cattle, goats and sheep require 0.1 units of grain each per day. Additional slaves require 0.04 units of grain each per day. When any of the above units are insufficiently maintained, they suffer one percent attrition per day. When a character has insufficient grain to support all of his assets, available grain is applied first to troops, then horses, then other animals.

Feudal levies require no maintenance, but suffer one percent attrition every day.

A character may hold one of each type of ship free of attrition. Additional ships suffer daily attrition of one-tenth of one percent.

Domiciles, town structures and strongpoints are reduced in size by 0.1 points per day. When they fall below 1.0 in size, they cease to exist.

Road patrols and strongpoint garrisons are reduced in size by 1/1,000 each day.

All servants require 0.1 coins maintenance per day. One percent of all unmaintained servants disappear.

Maximum health diminishes by 1/365 of one point per day.

## Marriage
An unmarried, untonsured male may make an offer of marriage at a town of which he is a citizen. The offer expires at the earlier of 30 days, or the date of his departure from the town. The female accepting the offer must be unmarried and untonsured. If the offer is accepted, the wedding takes place, at the site of the offer, 60 days after the date of the offer. For the wedding to take place, both must be present at the the site of the offer 60 days after the date of the offer. Both must be unmarried and untonsured at the time of the wedding. Everyone present at the town is assumed to be at the wedding. The value of the wedding is deemed to be 1/100 of the sum of the prestige of the attendees. Each attendee receives a prestige increase equal to the value of the wedding. The bride and groom receive double increases. Their two families enter into a marriage alliance.

The effects of a wedding are calculated during, and based on the situation at, the time of the first update after the ceremony.

## Marriage alliances
When two families are in a marriage alliance, should a member of either family issue battle orders against a member of the other family, or against a strongpoint owned by that family, or against a town de facto control of which is held by that family, the character issuing the battle orders suffers a loss of 300 points of prestige. Should he have fewer than 300 points of prestige, his troops will refuse to follow him into battle and the battle orders will fail.

## Movement by land
Land movement is from town to town along roads. Horses and camels may each carry four units of cargo. Slaves may carry one unit of cargo. Cannons constitute 100 units of cargo. Falconets constitute three units of cargo. Trade goods are one unit of cargo. Cattle, sheep, goats, slaves, servants, troops, crew, horses and camels walk on their own. The basic movement rate for a character not accompanied by foot traffic is six. For everyone else, it is three. Speed, in leagues per hour, is equal to the basic movement rate plus the character's travel skill times the basic movement rate divided by 10,000. (S=BMR+(T/10,000)*BMR) The toll due is equal to the number of units of cargo times the average toll rate for the two towns between which the road runs. No toll is due when the road patrol has fewer troops than does the character moving along the road. Court Officers never pay tolls on their Court Office assets. Court Office troops do not enter into the road patrol calculation that determines whether a toll is due. Once arrived in a town, a character may not move again for 24 hours. Leaving a town cancels all outstanding offers made by, or to, the leaver.

## Movement by water
Water movement can be along coasts, or rivers, or into open sea zones, or out of open sea zones. Barques are not allowed into open sea zones. Roundships are not allowed to sail along rivers. Barques may carry 100 units of cargo. Galliots may carry 300. Caravels may carry 500. Roundships may carry 1,000. Galleys may carry 2,000. In water movement, cannons count as 100 units of cargo, falconets as three, light cavalry as three, horses as two, heavy cavalry as four, crew and troops count as one, and all other trade goods count as one unit of cargo. Speed is doubled when a fleet includes no galleys, barques or galliots. Galleys require 100 crew. Galliots and caravels require 20. Roundships require 50. Barques require 10. Overloaded ships may not move.

In movement by water, basic speed is four leagues per hour. When barques, galliots or galleys are included, basic speed is two leagues per hour. In both cases, effective speed is equal to basic speed multiplied by navigation skill divided by 1,000. 

## Offer
Transactions between different families generally take the form of an offer made to all at the location. It is executed when accepted. It expires when the offerer leaves the town where it was issued. There is a base price for each type of good at each location. The player may offer his goods for sale at that price, for 10% more, or for 10% less. The maximum number of coins that may change hands in one transaction of this type is equal to 1,000 plus the seller's merchantry rating plus his banking rating plus the town's Guildhall rating. Sales may not take place in water zones.

## Poison
Females with poison ratings may poison others at their location. To do so, they must expend a number of coins equal to ten times the victim's prestige rating. The victim's loss of actual health is equal to one one-hundred-and-fiftieth of the poisoner's poison rating minus the total of the victim's poison rating plus the town's Hospital structure size. (Health Loss = (poisoner poison rating - victim poison rating - hospital size)/150). Lost actual health that does not cause death can be regained through herbalism. Poison skill may not be used more than once each thirty days. If the victim's health rating is at, or below, zero at the time of the next daily update, he dies. Poison skill determines the effectiveness of poisoning attempts. Defensively, it offsets a poisoner's poisoning skill.

## Prestige
Prestige is one of the factors that enters into the calculation of rank.

When a character leaves a town at which loyalty to his family is greater than zero, the townspeople's loyalty to his family increases by a number of points equal to one percent of his prestige.

The ten characters with the highest prestige attract volunteer heavy cavalry each day. The number of these free heavy cavalry ranges from 1.0 for the highest prestige to 0.1 heavy cavalry for the tenth highest prestige. Characters with no heavy cavalry receive no free heavy cavalry. Free heavy cavalry are subject to the same rules for maintenance and attrition as are recruited heavy cavalry. 

Titled characters receive a daily increase in their prestige ranging from 0.1 points for lords/signori, to 0.4 points for counts, 0.5 for marquises, 0.6 for dukes and 1.0 points for the Pope.

## Ranking
Rankings in fourteen categories are calculated daily. Besides an overall ranking they are for: prestige, troops, shipping, coins, court office assets, total size of all strongpoints owned by the family, total size of all domiciles owned by the family, total skill points, total population controlled as a sovereign, total population controlled as a feudatory, total population controlled as a tenant and total population controlled as a DFC. Each day, the ten characters with the highest prestige attract from 1.0 to 0.1 heavy cavalry as volunteers. The highest ranking character attracts 1.0. The tenth highest attracts 0.1. The ten characters with the highest overall ranking gain from 1.0 to 0.1 points of prestige. The highest ranking gains 1.0 points of prestige. The tenth highest gains 0.1 points of prestige. Overall rank has an adverse effect on the number of initiatives a character receives each day. The highest ranking character overall receives only 0.34 new initiatives each day while the lowest ranking character receives 3.0 new initiatives.

## Recruit
Towns have a limited number of recruits available. When troops, crew or servants are engaged, their number is subtracted from the number of recruits available at the town. Each town's recruit pool increases by one each day. For each initiative expended, the number of recruits that may be recruited is equal to one plus 1/100th of the family's loyalty rating at the town.

## Regular Playership
Regular playership entitles a player to issue battle orders, participate in a league and add characters to his family. The fee for regular playership is 25 cents per day per character.

## Sculpture
Producing a sculpture costs a number of coins equal to 2,000 minus the sculptor's sculpting rating. This rating may not be used again for 90 days minus a number of minutes equal to the total of his sculpting rating times 100 plus the town's gallery rating times 10, but the resulting figure may not be less than 30 days. The town's gallery rating increases by two points each time a sculpture is made. 

Sculptures may be donated to a Gallery. Donating a sculpture to a Gallery increases the donor's prestige by four, the Gallery's size by four and the town's loyalty to the donor's family by tewnty.

## Seniority points
A player acquires 0.067 seniority points each day on which he logs on. Seniority points enable a player to add characters to his family. To activate an additional character for his family, a player must expend a number of seniority points equal to the number of characters he will have by activating that character. For example, to activate a second character, he must expend two seniority points. To activate a fourth character, he would have to expend four seniority points.

Some families are available only by election. In playership elections, anyone with seniority points may cast ballots for himself. The number he may cast is equal to the unexpended seniority points he has accumulated. The losers of the election retain all of their seniority points. The winner expends all of his seniority points.

## Servant
Servants may be recruited for a price of ten coins each. They require daily maintenance of 0.1 coins. Unpaid servants suffer one percent attrition per day. Each day, the holder of the greatest number of servants gains 1.0 points of prestige. Characters are expected to have 0.01 servants per point of prestige. Each day, failure to have enough servants reduces their prestige by 0.001 points per missing 0.01 servants (in other words, they lose 0.1 points of prestige for each missing servant).

## Skill
Most actions require a skill for their accomplishment. Limitations on the reuse of skills are utilized to reflect the time required to generate the original outcome. Most actions cause their performer to gain one point of the pertinent skill. Individual skills are grouped together further down in the help topic index. Skills contribute to the overall ranking of characters. There are no limits to the skill points that a character can acquire. Skills may be passed on through instruction by another character. Each town has a local skill, which may be acquired by 'studying the local skill'.

## Speed
In overland movement, basic speed is six leagues per hour when all units are mounted. When moving with auxiliaries, pikemen, archers, arquebusiers, feudal levies, slaves, servants, crew, cattle, or sheep, basic speed is three leagues per hour. In both cases, basic speed is increased by a percentage equal to the characters's travel skill divided by 10,000.

In movement by water, basic speed is four leagues per hour. When barques, galliots or galleys are included, basic speed is two leagues per hour. In both cases, effective speed is equal to basic speed multiplied by navigation skill divided by 1,000.

## Statuettes
One statuette may be produced for each full hundred points in one's sculpting skill. Regardless of the number of statuettes produced, the process ties up the sculptor's skill for seven days. Each statuette is a trade good falling into the category of art. When statuettes are produced in a town with a pre-existing Gallery, the Gallery increases in size by 0.1 points.

## Title
There are various types of titles. Hereditary titles are those which are passed from an individual to his heir. Elective titles include the Doge of Venice, the Doge of Genoa, the Pope, Grandmasters of monastic orders, Bishops, Archbishops and Magistrates. Honorary titles are not inherited. A hereditary title may be acquired through the expenditure of three million coins for conspicuous consumption. The new title will have the form: Lord of X, with X being determined through consultation with the Gamemaster.

## Training
Skills may be acquired gradually by 'studying the local skill', by being trained by a family member, or by being trained by someone who has offered to train anyone at his location willing to pay his price.
## Transfer
Transfers of assets may be freely made between members of the same family. Some transfers may be made between suzerains and their court officers. Certain transfers are possible between court officers of the same suzerain. No other transfers between characters are possible. To move assets from one character to another to whom a transfer may not be made, a sell offer must be made and accepted. Trade goods may be given to the townspeople, thereby increasing their loyalty to the donor's family by 0.1 points for each trade good given them.

## Update
Once per day, generally around noon New York time, a daily update is executed. It entails the extraction of maintenance, various types of attrition, the recalculation of rankings, payment of remuneration to court officers and town structure heads, production and demand modifications, population changes and a number of other routine matters. The date and time of the most recent update always appears on the first logged-in page.

## Wealth
Coins spent in a town are generally added to the town's wealth.
Taxes, tithes, amercements, aids, the remuneration of structure heads and the gross price paid by towns for goods sold to them to satisfy their demand are subtracted from the town's wealth.
During the daily update, towns with above average wealth receive a population increase equal to one plus one tenth of one percent of their existing population.
Also during the daily update, each town receives a wealth increment equal to 20% of its population.

## Work of letters
Writing a positive work of letters increases the beneficiary's prestige by a number of points approximately equal to one-tenth of the square root of the writer's letters skill. It ties up his letters skill for seven days and increases the size of the town Library by one point.

Writing a negative work of letters reduces the town's loyalty to the victim family by a number approximately equal to one-tenth of the square root of the writer's letters skill. It ties up his letters skill for seven days and increases the size of the town's Library by one point.

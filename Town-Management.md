# Town Management

## Aid
A character present at a town over which he is sovereign may collect a feudal Aid in coins equal to 5% of the town's wealth. The funds are taken from the town's wealth. The sovereign's family loses 100 points of loyalty at the town. The sovereign's administrative skill may not be used again for seven days.

## Amercement
Amercements accumulate at each town each day. The tenant may collect these amercements. Each time he collects amercements, he may collect a maximum of four coins for each point in his law skill rating. Doing so ties up his law skill for 24 hours.

## Assize
The feudatory of a location may hold an assize. Doing so increases loyalty to his family at that town by a number of points equal to one plus the square root of half of his prestige. A character who holds an assize may not use law skill again for 48 hours.
## Banishment
The Justiciar to the local sovereign may banish a character from that location. Banishment lasts for one year. The Justiciar may not use his law skill again for seven days.

## Citizenship
Being the citizen of a town entitles one to buy, or sell, an extra 1,000 units of trade goods in one action at that town.
A character may hold citizenship in only one town at a time.
If he qualifies, he may request that the magistrate of a town allow him to change his citizenship to that of the magistrate's town. 
There are two ways to qualify.
The first is to have at least 10,000 points of loyalty at the town.
The second is to own a domicile at the town that is at least 1,000 points in size and no less than half the size of the largest domicile at the town.
The magistrate's decision is final, but the request may be renewed at any time.
## Court officer
Any holder of a hereditary, episcopal or elective title -- other than a magistracy -- may appoint court officers as a suzerain. Holders of multiple titles may appoint court officers for each of their titles, but they may not appoint court officers to the same court office under different suzerain titles. Court officers receive 25 coins per day in pay from their appointive suzerain. Suzerains gain one point of prestige per day per court officer. Suzerains also gain 0.1 initiatives per day per Court Officer. 

Court officers hold court office assets separately from their personal assets. A court officer's assets are always in one location. This location may, or may not, be the same as that of the holder of the court office. They may be used only when they are at the same location as the court officer. Court Officer assets may be freely transferred to their suzerain. Some court officers may transfer certain assets to certain other court officers. Court office assets always fight on the same side as their court officer. Maintenance of court office assets is done separately from that of a character's personal assets, but is done in the same way. Appointing a court officer ties up the appointer's administrative skill for 48 hours minus a number of minutes equal to his administrative rating. A character may hold only one Court Office at a time. A list of court offices appears lower in the help index. Information on individual offices may be obtained by clicking on the appropriate office.

The only Court Officer eligible to receive ships, or falconets as transfers is the Admiral.
The only Court Officers eligible to receive troops as transfers are the Admiral, the Constable and the Marshal.
The only Court Officers eligible to receive cannons as transfers are the Constable and the Marshal.
The only Court Officers eligible to receive grain or transport units as transfers are the Grand Equerry, the Court Chamberlain, the Admiral, the Constable and the Marshal.
The only Court Officer eligible to receive mercury, sulfur, saltpeter, or charcoal is the Court Alchemist.
The only Court Officers eligible to receive copper are the Court Alchemist and the Master of the Court Mint.
The only Court Officer eligible to receive gold or silver is the Master of the Court Mint.
The only Court Officers eligible to receive construction materials are the Court Architect and Master of Defenses.
Other types of goods may not be transferred to any Court Officer.
## DFC (de facto controller)
The de facto controler -- the DFC -- of a town is the only person who may change the sovereign of the town. He may change the sovereignty to any non-honorary title in the title data table. Doing so ties up his administrative skill for 24 hours. 

The DFC of a town may transfer de facto control to the tenant of the town. Doing so ties up his administrative skill for 24 hours.

The DFC may change the method of magistrate selection. Doing so ties up his administration skill for 24 hours. To change the method of magistrate selection away from 'by election' costs the DFC's family 1,000 points of loyalty at that town.
When a town has no DFC, the tenant may claim de facto control. Doing so ties up his administration skill for 30 days.
## Donation
Donations to town structures enhance the structure, increase the donor's prestige and increase the town's loyalty to his family. Specific details can be found in the list of structures appearing lower in the help index.
## Domicile
Domiciles increase by one hundred units the maximum size of purchases one may make from, and sales one may make to, a town. Domiciles whose size is greater than 100, increase the maximum size of purchases and sales by one point for each point of the domicile's size. Domiciles deteriorate by 0.1 points each day. A domicile whose size falls below 1.0 ceases to exist. Domiciles are not considered to be town structures. Building, or enlarging, a domicile requires the expenditure of 1,000 coins and 100 construction materials of the same type. The 1,000 coins are added to the town's wealth. The increase in the size of the domicile is equal to one plus the square root of the builder's architecture rating. His architecture rating is tied up for seven days minus a number of minutes equal to his architecture rating. Ownership of domiciles may not be transferred.
## Elections
When an elective position is vacant, anyone eligible to vote for the position may initiate an election by casting the first vote. Elections generally last about thirty days. Their inception is listed in the report of events. Papal elections last thirty days. Normally, only those who voted for themselves are eligible to win. Voting for oneself constitutes an acceptance of the elective position and of the divestiture of any incompatible positions, which is done automatically during the resolution of the elective process. Characters who have been nominated in an election for magistrate, bishop or archbishop, but are unable to vote for themselves in that election, may render themselves eligible to win by formally accepting (after the election has commenced, and before it ends) their potential election. This type of acceptance ties up the characters politics skill for 30 days, and subjects him to the same divestiture rules as a regular candidate. In any election in which they cast a vote, candidates receive a number of bonus votes equal to 1/1,000 of their rating for political skill.

Elections are resolved during the first update subsequent to the scheduled termination time for the election.
## Elective Title
The Pope, the Holy Roman Emperor, archbishops, bishops, the Grandmasters of the monastic orders, the Doge of Venice, the Doge of Genoa and some magistracies are elective. 

## Epidemics
Each day, one town will be afflicted by an epidemic disease. Those present at the afflicted town on that day suffer a health loss of 0.1 points. The town itself loses one percent of its population. The population loss is reduced by a fraction equal to the size of its Hospital divided by 10,000. (Consequently, a town with a Hospital rated at 10,000 will suffer no population loss.) Troops and workers present at the town are reduced in number by one percent.

Each day, a random factor determines whether the epidemic remains in the same town, is extinguished, or moves to another town linked by road or by a water connection. At any given time, one, and only one, town will be afflicted with an epidemic.
## FAR (fortification against artillery)
FAR is a town's fortification against artillery. Increasing FAR requires the expenditure of 100 construction materials of one type and 1,000 coins. The coins are added to the town's wealth. The FAR increase is equal to one plus one-tenth of the square root of the fortifier's fortification rating. The town's loyalty to the fortifier's family increases by ten points.

## FAS (fortification against assault)
FAS is a town's fortification against assault. Increasing FAS requires the expenditure of 100 construction materials of one type and 1,000 coins. The coins are added to the town's wealth. The FAS increase is equal to one plus one-tenth of the square root of the fortifier's fortification rating. The town's loyalty to the fortifier's family increases by ten points. During the daily update a town's population increases by a number equal to one percent of the size of its FAS.
## Feudal Aid
A character present at a town over which he is sovereign may collect a feudal Aid in coins equal to 5% of the town's wealth. The funds are taken from the town's wealth. The sovereign's family loses 100 points of loyalty at the town. The sovereign's administrative skill may not be used again for seven days.
## Feudal levy
A feudatory of a town where his family has loyalty of at least 100 can raise a feudal levy at that town. Feudal levies consist of 500 feudal levy troops with a starting morale equal to the feudatory's family's loyalty at the town. Raising a feudal levy reduces the feudatory's family's loyalty rating by 100 points. One percent of feudal levy troops go home each day. Effective August 1, 2018/1497, 2% of feudal levy troops will go home per day. Feudal levy troops require no maintenance. 

Feudal levies are recruited from the feudal estates surrounding a town. They are collected in a town, but their recruitment is not affected by, and does not affect, town populations.
## Feudatory
Feudatories may raise feudal levies. They may increase tolls. They may collect a town's accumulation of tolls. Collecting tolls ties up their administrative skill for 48 hours minus a number of minutes equal to their administrative skill rating. A feudatory may change the tenancy of the town over which he is feudatory to any non-honorary title in the title data table. Changing the tenancy away from the town's elective magistrate results in a 500-point reduction in the town's loyalty to the feudatory's family. Changing the tenant of a town ties up one's administrative skill for 24 hours. A town's feudatory may be changed by the town's sovereign. Changing a town's feudatory ties up the sovereign's administrative skill for 24 hours.
## Garrison troops
Town garrison troops defend towns against assault. Strongpoint garrison troops defend strongpoints against assault. Both suffer daily attrition equal to one-tenth of one percent. Transferring troops to a town garrison earns a family one-tenth of a point of loyalty per troop. Anyone may transfer troops to a town garrison. Only members of the owning family may transfer troops to a strongpoint. Neither crew nor feudal levy troops may be converted to garrison troops. Once troops have been transferred to a garrison, they may not be transferred back. The transfer of troops to garrisons may not be made until one has been at a location for at least 24 hours.
## Hold court
A sovereign may hold court. Doing so ties up his administrative skill for 48 hours and increases the town's loyalty to his family by a number of points equal to one plus the square root of half of his prestige rating.

## Investment in production
A character holding the Court Office of Chancellor may increase the production rate of a type of trade goods by 0.2 percentage points with the expenditure (from his Chancellor assets) of 20,000 coins. This action increases the town's loyalty to his family by 20 points, augments by one point the size of an existing Guildhall and increases his administration skill by one point. His administration skill may not be used again for 48 hours minus one minute for each point in his administration skill rating.

## Loyalty
Each town has the capacity to have loyalty to one, or more, families. This loyalty can be increased by holding court, strengthening fortifications, making donations to town structures, holding assizes, celebrating the Feast Day of the town's patron saint, giving trade goods to the townspeople, or by leaving the town. It can be reduced through the production of critical works of letters and through the production of forgeries impugning a family. Loyalty influences the outcome of battles, the ability to recruit troops at the location, and the willingness of merchants to trade.
A loyalty level of 10,000 entitles a character to request citizenship.
Loyalty diminishes by 0.1 points each day through normal attrition.
Giving trade goods to the townspeople earns the donor one point of loyalty per fifty trade goods donated. Effective December 1, trade goods given to a town to increase its loyalty will have to be of types not produced by the town.

## Magistrate
The magistrate of a town can collect its accumulated tariffs. Doing so ties up his administration skill for 48 hours minus a number of minutes equal to his administration skill.

The magistrate may raise, or lower, the town's tariffs by one percentage point at a time. Each tariff change costs his family 20 points of loyalty at that town. Changing a tariff ties up his administration skill for seven days minus a number of minutes equal to 3.5 times his administration skill. 

The magistrate appoints the heads of the following town structures: the Shipyard, Academy, Athenaeum, Library, Gallery, Odeon, Guild Hall, Armory, Almshouse, Town Mint and the Bank. All appointees must be male. Appointing a structure head ties up the magistrate's administration skill for 24 hours minus a number of minutes equal to his administration rating. A Magistrate receives a bonus of 0.1 initiatives per day for each structure in his town with a head. 

Magistrates can be selected by appointment, or by election. The method of selection is indicated in the town data. Appointed magistrates serve until replaced. Offering a magistrate appointment ties up the offerer's administration skill for a period of 250 hours minus 7.5 minutes per point of administration skill held by the offerer. The term of office of an elected magistrate ends on October 1. All male citizens of the town present at the town are eligible to vote. In addition to votes cast by citizens, each candidate receives a number of votes equal to his prestige divided by 1000 plus an additional number of votes equal to his politics skill divided by 1,000. To qualify for election, a candidate must vote for himself. Upon election, a new magistrate is divested of any other magistracy he may hold.

No character may hold more than one magistracy at a time.

A town's method of magistrate selection can be changed by the de facto controller.

## Population
During each daily update, all populations are increased by one. The populations of those towns whose wealth is greater than average increase by one plus 1/1,000 of the current population. The population of each town possessing the largest town structure of its type increases by one each day. Population also increases by a number equal to one percent of the sum of the sizes of all of the town's structures plus its FAS. Population declines at the end of each day on which a town's demand for a category of goods is greater than 334 times the town's population times the town's listed incremental rate for that category of goods. The rate of decline is .0003 times the population per day per unsatisfied category. Population loss is quadrupled when the unsatisfied demand category is food. Population can also decline due to epidemics, or military activity.

## Production
Each town produces up to ten types of goods, which are available for purchase. Town data indicates type, category, quantity available, efficiency and workers. Efficiency is a constant that determines the number of goods produced per worker. Worker allocation is recalculated each day to move workers towards the production of those types of goods which the town is most successful in selling. The quantity available increases each day by a number equal to the population times the efficiency figure times the workers figure times 0.01.

If the quantity available at the end of the day is less than one, the price is increased by one-tenth of one percent, and the worker allocation is increased by one one-hundredth of one percent, but the daily increase in worker allocation cannot exceed one full point.

If the quantity available is greater than the worker figure times the efficiency figure times the population, price is reduced by one-tenth of one percent and the workers figure is reduced by one one-hundredth of one percent.

## Sovereign
Sovereigns may hold court. Doing so increases the town's loyalty to their family by a number of points equal to one plus the square root of half of their prestige. It ties up the sovereign's administration skill for 48 hours. The sovereign's Seneschal may collect a town's accumulation of taxes. 

A sovereign may change feudatory status of a town over which he is sovereign to any non-honorary title in the title data table. Changing the feudatory away from the town's elective magistrate results in a 500-point reduction in the town's loyalty to the sovereign's family. Changing the feudatory of a town ties up one's administrative skill for 24 hours. 

A sovereign may collect an Aid in the amount of 5% of the wealth of a town. Doing so results in a reduction by 100 points of the loyalty of the town to the sovereign's family. It ties up the sovereign's administration skill for seven days minus a number of minutes equal to 3.5 times his administration skill. 

A town's sovereign may be changed by the town's de facto controller(DFC).

## Strongpoint
Each family may own a strongpoint at each location. Strongpoint ownership raises the overall ranking of members of the owning family. Strongpoints facilitate trade with townspeople, play a role in military activities and serve as depots for trade goods. Building, or adding to, a strongpoint requires the expenditure of 8,000 coins and 100 construction materials of one type. The strongpoint's size increase is roughly equal to the square root of the builder's fortification skill. It ties up the builder's fortification skill for seven days minus a number of minutes equal to his fortification skill.

Strongpoints may hold in storage any one type of trade good. Goods may be transferred to the strongpoint solely by members of the family that owns it. Goods may be transferred from the strongpoint solely to members of the family that owns it.

Strongpoint garrisons consist of troops transferred to the strongpoint by members of the owning family. Once transferred to the strongpoint, they lose their type identity and become ordinary strongpoint garrison troops. For example, heavy cavalry and auxiliaries both become ordinary strongpoint garrison troops. Neither feudal levy troops, nor crew, may be transferred to strongpoints. Once transferred to a strongpoint, troops may not be transferred away from the strongpoint.
Stronpoints lose 0.1 points of size per day. When they fall below 1.0 in size, they cease to exist. When a strongpoint ceases to exist, all of its contents are lost.

## Structure
Each town may have up to 18 town structures. Information about individual types of town structures can be found in a lower section of the help topic index. The head of a town structure other than a Convent must be a male. Convent heads must be female. No one may serve as head of more than one structure at a time. Each structure with a head gains 0.2 points in size per day. When the head is present at the site of the structure, this size increase is doubled to 0.4 points. A magistrate receives an extra 0.1 initiatives per day for each structure in his town with a head. 

During the daily update a town's population increases by a number equal to one percent of the sum of the sizes of its structures. Having the largest structure of its type, causes a town's population to increase by an additional one person each day. Having the most total structure points also increases a town's population by one per day. The second largest structure of each category attracts 0.9 population per day. The third largest 0.8 population, etc. Universities confer triple the normal population bonus for size.

Structures deteriorate by 0.1 points per day. When they fall below 1.0 in size, they cease to exist. Building, or expanding, a town structure requires the expenditure of 1,000 coins and 100 construction materials of one type. The size increase is roughly equal to one-tenth of the square root of the builder's architecture rating. The builder's architecture rating is tied up for seven days minus a number of minutes equal to his architecture rating. During the daily update, each town structure head receives as remuneration 1/100,000 of the town's wealth.

## Suzerain
Anyone who holds a title that is hereditary, or elective -- other than a magistracy -- may appoint court officers. An appointer of a court officer is his suzerain.

## Tariffs
The magistrate of a town can collect its accumulated tariffs. Doing so ties up his administration skill for 48 hours minus a number of minutes equal to his administration skill.
The magistrate may raise, or lower, the town's tariffs by one percentage point at a time. Each tariff change costs his family 20 points of loyalty at that town. Changing a tariff ties up his administration skill for seven days minus a number of minutes equal to 3.5 times his administration skill.

## Tax
During the daily update 1/10,000 of a town's wealth is transferred to its accumulated tax account. This accumulation may be picked up at any time by the sovereign's Seneschal. Collecting the accumulated taxes ties up the Seneschal's administration skill for 48 hours minus a number of minutes equal to his adminstration rating.

## Tenant
Tenants may collect a town's accumulated amercements. Collecting amercements ties up their administration skill for 24 hours.
A town's tenant may be changed by the town's feudatory to any non-honorary title in the title data table.
When a town has no DFC, the tenant may claim de facto control. Doing so ties up his administration skill for 30 days.

## Tithe
During the daily update 2/10,000 of a town's wealth is transferred to its accumulated tithe account. This accumulation may be picked up at any time by the bishop in whose see a town falls. When a Catholic town does not fall into a bishop's see, it is directly under the control of its archbishop, who may collect the tithe himself. Collecting the accumulated tithes ties up the collector's administration skill for 48 hours minus a number of minutes equal to his administration skill.

## Toll
Each town has a toll rate set by its feudatory. The toll on a particular road is the total of the tolls prevailing at its two ends. To increase the toll by 0.1 coins per item using the road, the feudatory must give up 100 points of the town's loyalty to his family. Doing so ties up his administration skill for 7 days minus a number of minutes equal to 3.5 times his administration rating. Reducing a toll by 0.1 ties up his administration skill for the same amount of time, but does not impair loyalty to his family.

The feudatory may collect the town's accumulated tolls. Doing so ties up his administration skill for 48 hours minus a number of minutes equal to his administration rating. Toll rates may not be lower than 0.01 coins per unit of cargo.

No toll is charged for Court Office assets. Tolls are not collected when a character's personal assets include more troops than are patrolling the road.
## Wealth
Coins spent in a town are generally added to the town's wealth.
Taxes, tithes, amercements, aids, the remuneration of structure heads and the gross price paid by towns for goods sold to them to satisfy their demand are subtracted from the town's wealth.
During the daily update, towns with above average wealth receive a population increase equal to one plus one tenth of one percent of their existing population.
Also during the daily update, each town receives a wealth increment equal to 20% of its population.

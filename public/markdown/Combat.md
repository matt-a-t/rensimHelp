## Troops
---------

#### Arquebusiers
To recruit arquebusiers, one must expend 40 coins and one arquebus per recruit. Each character may hold 200 arquebusiers free of maintenance. Any additional arquebusiers require 0.2 units of grain per day in maintenance. If unmaintained, these excess arquebusiers suffer one percent attrition per day. Arquebusiers fight most effectively in forested terrain. They provide suppressing fire in assaults on towns or strongpoints.

### Auxiliaries
To recruit auxiliaries, one must expend 20 coins and one unit of swords per recruit. Each character may hold 200 auxiliaries free of maintenance. Any additional auxiliaries require 0.1 units of grain per day in maintenance. If unmaintained, these excess auxiliaries suffer one percent attrition per day. Auxiliaries fight most effectively in mountain terrain. They are the only troops that can assault the walls of towns or strongpoints.

### Bowmen
To recruit bowmen, one must expend 80 coins and one bow per recruit. Each character may hold 200 bowmen free of maintenance. Any additional bowmen require 0.1 units of grain per day in maintenance. If unmaintained, these excess bowmen suffer one percent attrition per day. Bowmen are most effective in swampy terrain. They provide suppressing fire in assaults on towns or strongpoints.

### Feudal levy
A feudatory of a town where his family has loyalty of at least 100 can raise a feudal levy at that town. Feudal levies consist of 500 feudal levy troops with a starting morale equal to the feudatory's family's loyalty at the town. Raising a feudal levy reduces the feudatory's family's loyalty rating by 100 points. One percent of feudal levy troops go home each day. Effective August 1, 2018/1497, 2% of feudal levy troops will go home per day. Feudal levy troops require no maintenance. 

Feudal levies are recruited from the feudal estates surrounding a town. They are collected in a town, but their recruitment is not affected by, and does not affect, town populations.

### Garrison troops
Town garrison troops defend towns against assault. Strongpoint garrison troops defend strongpoints against assault. Both suffer daily attrition equal to one-tenth of one percent. Transferring troops to a town garrison earns a family one-tenth of a point of loyalty per troop. Anyone may transfer troops to a town garrison. Only members of the owning family may transfer troops to a strongpoint. Neither crew nor feudal levy troops may be converted to garrison troops. Once troops have been transferred to a garrison, they may not be transferred back. The transfer of troops to garrisons may not be made until one has been at a location for at least 24 hours.

### Heavy cavalry
To recruit heavy cavalry, one must expend 200 coins, four horses and one unit of armor per recruit. Each character may hold 20 heavy cavalry free of maintenance. Any additional heavy cavalry require 0.4 units of grain per day in maintenance. If unmaintained, this excess heavy cavalry suffers one percent attrition per day. Heavy cavalry fight best in plains.

### Light cavalry
To recruit light cavalry, one must expend 100 coins, one horse and one unit of swords per recruit. Each character may hold 200 light cavalry free of maintenance. Any additional light cavalry require 0.2 units of grain per day in maintenance. If unmaintained, this excess light cavalry suffers one percent attrition per day. Light cavalry are most effective in deserts.

### Morale
Morale determines the ability of troops to fight. It can be enhanced through sermonizing, the giving of alcohol to troops, and through the payment of bonuses. It fluctuates with the results of combat. The payment of coin bonuses to troops increases the morale of one troop by one point for each coin expended. During the daily update, as well as at the start of battles, morale ratings over 3,000 are reduced to 3,000.

The morale of Court Office troops may be increased through the payment of coin bonuses (with coins held as Court Office assets), but not through sermonizing or the provision of alcohol.

### Pikemen
To recruit pikemen, one must expend 50 coins and one pike per recruit. Each character may hold 200 pikemen free of maintenance. Any additional pikemen require 0.2 units of grain per day in maintenance. If unmaintained, these excess pikemen suffer one percent attrition per day. Pikemen fight most effectively in hill terrain.

## Equipment
------------

### Armor
Armor is used to equip heavy cavalry. It may also be used to meet a town's demand for weapons. Armor may be produced through the expenditure of one iron and ten coins per unit of armor. Coins expended to produce armor are added to the town's wealth. In one action, a character may produce a maximum number of units of armor equal to half of the square root of his smithery rating. His smithery rating may not be used again for seven days minus a number of minutes equal to the total of his smithery rating plus the rating of the town's armory structure. When armor is produced in a town with a pre-existing Armory, the Armory increases in size by 0.1 points.

#### Arquebus
Arquebuses are used to equip arquebusiers. They may also be used to meet a town's demand for weapons. Arquebuses may be produced through the expenditure of a total of one one unit of iron, one timber, one sulfur, one saltpeter and one charcoal plus one coin per arquebus. Coins expended to produce arquebuses are added to the town's wealth. In one action, a character may produce a number of arquebuses equal to the square root of his gunsmithing rating. His gunsmithing rating may not be used again for three days minus a number of minutes equal to the total of his gunsmithing rating plus the rating of the town's armory structure. When arquebuses are produced in a town with a pre-existing Armory, the Armory increases in size by 0.1 points.

### Bow
Bows are used to equip bowmen. They may also be used to meet a town's demand for weapons. Bows may be produced through the expenditure of one coin per bow plus a total of one unit of timber for whatever number of bows is produced. Coins expended to produce bows are added to the town's wealth. In one action, a character may produce a number of bows equal to the square root of his bowyery rating. His bowyery rating may not be used again for three days minus a number of minutes equal to the total of his bowyery rating plus the rating of the town's armory structure. When bows are produced in a town with a pre-existing Armory, that Armory increases in size by 0.1 points.

### Cannon
Cannons are used to reduce fortifications. They may also be used to meet a town's demand for weapons. To be able to produce a cannon, one must have a cannonmaking rating of at least 900. To make one cannon, one must expend 100 iron, 10 saltpeter, 10 sulfur, 10 charcoal and 100 coins. Coins expended to produce a cannon are added to the town's wealth. The cannonmaker's cannonmaking rating may not be used again for thirty days minus a number of minutes equal to the total of his cannonmaking rating times 10 plus the rating of the town's armory structure times 3. When a cannon is produced in a town with a pre-existing Armory, that Armory increases in size by 0.1 points. A cannon constitutes 100 units of cargo.

### Falconet
Falconets are used in maritime battles. They may also be used to meet a town's demand for weapons. To be able to produce falconets, one must expend a total of one saltpeter, one sulfur and one charcoal plus 10 coins and one iron per falconet produced. The coins are added to the town's wealth. The maximum number of falconets one can make at one time is equal to one-tenth of the square root of one's cannonmaking rating. Coins expended to produce a falconet are added to the town's wealth. The falconet maker's cannonmaking rating may not be used again for seven days minus a number of minutes equal to the total of his cannonmaking rating plus the rating of the town's armory structure. When falconets are produced in a town with a pre-existing Armory, that Armory is increased in size by 0.1 points.

### Pike
Pikes are used to equip pikemen. They may also be used to meet a town's demand for weapons. Pikes may be produced through the expenditure of a total of one one unit of timber and one unit of iron plus one coin per pike. Coins expended to produce pike are added to the town's wealth. In one action, a character may produce a number of pikes equal to half the square root of his smithery rating. His smithery rating may not be used again for three days minus a number of minutes equal to the total of his smithery rating plus the rating of the town's armory structure. When pikes are produced in a town with a pre-existing Armory, that Armory is increased in size by 0.1 points.

### Sword
Swords are used to equip auxiliaries. They may also be used to meet a town's demand for weapons. Swords may be produced through the expenditure of a total of one coin per sword plus one unit of iron in total for whatever number of swords is produced through that action. Coins expended to produce swords are added to the town's wealth. In one action, a character may produce a number of swords equal to the square root of his smithery rating. His smithery rating may not be used again for three days minus a number of minutes equal to his smithery rating plus the rating of the town's armory structure. When swords are produced in a town with a pre-existing Armory, that Armory is increased in size by 0.1 points.

## Battles
----------

### Assault
Three types of assault are possible: assaults on towns for plunder (see 'plunder'), assaults on towns for de facto control (see 'assault for control'), and assaults on strongpoints to destroy the strongpoint (see 'assault strongpoint'.)
To initiate an assault, a character must have a minimum of 100 points of prestige and one initiative.
If the attacker is the local commander for a league, all league members present at the town participate in the attack.
If the attacker is a league member, but not the local commander, he receives no support from other league members.
Court Office troops present at the location participate on the side of the holder of the Court Office.

In League assaults, the 'assaulter's loyalty' rating is that of the family of the character who issued the assault order. The 'assaulter's strongpoint' rating is that of the family of the character who issued the assault order. The participation of other families in the assaulting alliance does not increase the 'assaulter's loyalty' rating nor the 'assaulter's strongpoint' rating.

For every hundred troops his side loses in an assault, an assaulter gains one point of military skill and loses one point of prestige. For every hundred troops he kills in an assault, he gains one point of prestige.

### Assault a town to take de facto control
An individual may order his troops to assault a town for the purpose of taking de facto control (DFC). Assault orders are executed 72 hours after they are initiated. In assaults only auxiliaries climb the walls. They are supported by suppressing fire from the assaulter's bowmen and arquebusiers. Cavalry, pikemen and feudal levies do not participate in assaults. When all defending garrison troops are killed, the character ordering the assault takes de facto control of the town. Should any garrison troops survive, the assault fails and DFC remains unchanged. 
An assault starts with the infliction of casualties upon the assaulting auxiliaries by the defending garrison troops. Each garrison troop kills a number of auxiliaries equal to ((N-B-Q) x FAS/1000)/1,000. (N=the town's total loyalty to all families minus twice the town's loyalty to the asssaulter's family. B=the attacker's number of bowmen times their morale divided by 3,000. Q=the attacker's number of arquebusiers times their morale divided by 3,000. FAS=the town's Fortification Against Assault. If N-B-Q is calculated to be less than 100, then N-B-Q is deemed to be 100.) The assaulter's surviving auxiliaries each kill the defending garrison troops according to the following formula: M/1000 x (Mi/1000+S/1000). (M=the auxiliaries' morale. Mi=the assaulter's military rating. S=the size of the assaulter's strongpoint, if any, at the location being assaulted.)
Succeeding in taking de facto control of a location does not give the assaulter the benefits of plunder. Morale changes are equal to 1/10th of the difference in total kills extracted.

### Assault a strongpoint
An individual may order his troops to assault and destroy a strongpoint. Assault orders are executed 72 hours after they are initiated. In assaults only auxiliaries climb the walls. They are supported by suppressing fire from the assaulter's bowmen and arquebusiers. Cavalry, pikemen and feudal levies do not participate directly in assaults. When all defending garrison troops are killed, the strongpoint and all of its contents, are destroyed. When any garrison troops survive, the strongpoint remains unscathed.
An assault starts with the infliction of casualties upon the assaulting auxiliaries by the defending garrison troops. Each garrison troop kills a number of auxiliaries equal to (S-B-Q) x S/1000. (S=the size of the strongpoint. B=the attacker's number of bowmen times their morale divided by 3,000. Q=the attacker's number of arquebusiers times their morale divided by 3,000. If S-B-Q is calculated to be less than 100, then S-B-Q is deemed to be 100.) The assaulter's surviving auxiliaries each kill the defending garrison troops according to the following formula: M/1000 x Mi/1000. (M=the auxiliaries' morale. Mi=the assaulter's military rating.) Morale changes are equal to 1/10th of the difference in total kills extracted.

### Battles
To issue battle orders, a character must have a prestige rating of at least 100 and at least one point of military skill. Land battle orders may be issued to engage other characters in field battle, to assault towns or strongpoints (see 'Assault'), or to bombard towns or strongpoints (see 'Siege Bombardment'. For every hundred troops his side loses in field battle, a character gains one point of military skill and loses one point of prestige. For every hundred troops his side kills in field battle, he gains one point of prestige. The character who initiates the battle, or is the designated defender in a battle, gains an additional one point of military skill. Court Office assets at the same location as the holder of the Court Office fight on his side. Issuing battle orders increases a character's military skill by one point. Battle orders may be canceled at any time prior to the occurrence of the battle. Canceling battle orders costs the canceler three points of prestige. Issuing battle orders against someone with whom one is in a marriage alliance reduces the attacker's prestige by 300 points.

### Blockade
Three types of blockades are possible: market blockades, road blockades and naval blockades. Anyone with one, or more, land troops may institute a road blockade, or a market blockade. Anyone with fully-crewed ships not overloaded with cargo may dinstitute a naval blockade. Blockades apply to anyone who is neither a member of the blockader's family, nor a member of the same League as the blockader. When a market is blockaded, no one to whom it applies may buy goods from the townspeople, nor sell goods to the townspeople. When a road is being blockaded, no one to whom it applies may leave the town in any direction except the one whence he came. When a naval blockade has been established, anyone to whom it applies who arrives at, or leaves from, the town by water is automatically engaged in naval battle with the naval blockader. Blockades last until they are terminated by the blockader, or ended by his departure from the town. A town may have no more than one naval blockade active at any one time. Establishing a blockade ends any pre-existing blockades being conducted by the establisher of the new blockade.

### Bombardment of strongpoint
Siege bombardment can be used to reduce the size of a strongpoint. Bombardment orders are executed 72 hours after they are issued. Each cannon reduces the strongpoint by a number of points equal to the bombarder's gunnery rating divided by 500. Each cannon suffers impairment of 2% each time it is used in bombardment.

### Bombardment of town
Siege bombardment can be used to reduce the FAS (Fortification Against Assault) of a town. Bombardment orders are executed 72 hours after they are issued. Each cannon reduces FAS by a number of points equal to 1/500th of the excess of the bombarder's gunnery rating over the town's FAR (Fortification Against Artillery). Each cannon suffers impairment of 2% each time it is used in bombardment.

### Cancel battle orders
Battle orders may be cancelled at any time prior to the occurrence of the battle. Cancelling battle orders costs the canceller three points of prestige.

### FAR (fortification against artillery)
FAR is a town's fortification against artillery. Increasing FAR requires the expenditure of 100 construction materials of one type and 1,000 coins. The coins are added to the town's wealth. The FAR increase is equal to one plus one-tenth of the square root of the fortifier's fortification rating. The town's loyalty to the fortifier's family increases by ten points.

### FAS (fortification against assault)
FAS is a town's fortification against assault. Increasing FAS requires the expenditure of 100 construction materials of one type and 1,000 coins. The coins are added to the town's wealth. The FAS increase is equal to one plus one-tenth of the square root of the fortifier's fortification rating. The town's loyalty to the fortifier's family increases by ten points. During the daily update a town's population increases by a number equal to one percent of the size of its FAS.

### Field battle
There are three types of field battle:
1. Field battle to force defender to return whence he came
2. Field battle to destroy defender's goods
3. Field battle to kill the defender

Each of these three types of field battle has its own help page.
To initiate a field battle, a character must have a minimum of 100 points of prestige and one initiative.
A character may not initiate a field battle against someone else in the same league.
A character conducting a naval blockade may not be engaged in field battle, nor initiate a land battle.
Initiating field battle against an ally by marriage costs 300 points in prestige.
If the attacker is the local commander for a league, all league members present at the town participate in the attack.
If the attacker is a league member, but not the local commander, he receives no support from other league members.
If the defender is a member of a league, whether or not he is the local commander, all members of the league present at the location support him.
Court Office troops present at the location participate on the side of the holder of the Court Office.
Strongpoints held by families fighting on a side reduce its losses by a number of percentage points equal to the total value of all of these strongpoints divided by 100, but never by more than 90%.

Field battles are fought in twelve rounds.
During these rounds, the attackers' military skill rating (Mi) is equal to 1/1,000th of the total of their commander's military rating plus 100. The attackers' equitation rating (Eq) is equal to 1/1,000th of the total of his equitation rating plus 100. The attackers' morale (Mo) for each troop type is equal to 1/1,000th of the weighted average of each group of troops within that type.
The defenders' military rating is equal to 1/1,000th of the total of 100 plus the highest military rating held by a defender. The defenders' equitation rating is equal to 1/1,000 of the total of 100 plus the highest equitation rating held by a defender. The defenders' morale for each troop type is equal to 1/1,000th of the weighted average of each group of troops within that type.

Round 1: The defending bowmen each kill Mi x Mo attackers. These losses are extracted from feudal levies, then auxiliaries, then pikemen, then arquebusiers, then bowmen, then light cavalry, then heavy cavalry.
Round 2: The attackers' surviving bowmen then each kill Mi x Mo attackers. These losses are extracted from feudal levies, then auxiliaries, then pikemen, then arquebusiers, then bowmen, then light cavalry, then heavy cavalry.
Round 3: The surviving defending arquebusiers then each kill Mi x Mo attackers. These losses are extracted the same way as Round 1 losses.
Round 4: The surviving attacking arquebusiers then each kill Mi x Mo defenders. These losses are extracted the same way as Round 2 losses.
Round 5: The surviving defending light cavalry kill 3 x Mo x Mi x Eq attackers. Losses are extracted from feudal levies, then auxiliaries, then arquebusiers, then bowmen, then light cavalry. Pikemen and heavy cavalry are unaffected.
Round 6: The surviving attacking light cavalry kill 3 x Mo x MI x Eq defenders. Losses are extracted from feudal levies, then auxiliaries, then arquebusiers, then bowmen, then light cavalry. Pikemen and heavy cavalry are unaffected.
Round 7: The surviving defending heavy cavalry kill 6 x Mo x Mi x Eq attackers. Losses are extracted from feudal levies, then auxiliaries, then arquebusiers, then bowmen, then light cavalry, then heavy cavalry. Pikemen are unaffected.
Round 8: The surviving attacking heavy cavalry kill 6 x Mo x Mi x Eq defenders. Losses are extracted from feudal levies, then auxiliaries, then arquebusiers, then bowmen, then light cavalry, then heavy cavalry. Pikemen are unaffected.
Round 9: The surviving defending infantry kill Mi x Mo attackers, but feudal levies kill at half that rate. Losses are extracted from feudal levies, then auxiliaries, then pikemen, then arquebusiers, then bowmen. Cavalry are unaffected.
Round 10: The surviving attacking infantry kill Mi x Mo defenders, but feudal levies kill at half that rate. Losses are extracted from feudal levies, then auxiliaries, then pikemen, then arquebusiers, then bowmen. Cavalry are unaffected.
Round 11: Surviving defending pikemen kill Mo x Mi attackers. Losses are extracted from feudal levies, then auxiliaries, then pikemen, then arquebusiers, then bowmen, then light cavalry, then heavy cavalry.
Round 12: Surviving attacking pikemen kill Mo x Mi defenders. Losses are extracted from feudal levies, then auxiliaries, then pikemen, then arquebusiers, then bowmen, then light cavalry, then heavy cavalry.

During all rounds except the general infantry rounds (rounds 9 and 10), the troop type with the terrain advantage inflicts double the casualties it would normally inflict. Heavy cavalry have the advantage on plains, light cavalry in deserts, pikemen in hills, auxiliaries in mountains, archers in swamps and arquebusiers in forests.

All participants in the battle share troop losses in proportion to their contribution by troop type.
Morale changes are equal to 1/10th of the difference in total kills extracted.
The named defender and the attackers' commander each suffer health loss equal to 1/1,000th of the number of troops lost by his side.
Only the named defender can be forced to leave town, be despoiled of his goods, or killed outright.
A very feeble attack commander, or named defender, may die as a result of loss of health.
The military skill of the attackers' commander and of the named defender increase by one point plus 1/100th of the number of troops lost by his side.
The equitation skill of the attackers' commander and of the named defender increase by one point plus 1/100th of the number of cavalry lost by his side.

### Field battle to force defender to return whence he came
This type of field battle is fought under the general rules for field battles.
To force the named defender to retreat to his prior location, the attackers must end the battle with more land troops than the defenders and the attackers must have suffered no more losses than the defenders.

### Field battle to destroy defender's goods
This type of field battle is fought under the general rules for field battles.
To destroy the defender's goods, the attackers must end the battle with at least ten times as many land troops as the defenders and the attackers must have suffered no more losses than the defenders.

### Field battle to kill the defender
This type of field battle is fought under the general rules for field battles. Should the defender end the battle with zero land troops, he dies and the attacker loses 500 points of prestige. Should the defender end the battle with any land troops, he does not die, and the attacker does not lose the 500 points of prestige he would lose had he succeeded in killing his victim.

### Plunder
An individual may order his troops to assault a town for the purpose of taking plunder. Assault orders are executed 72 hours after they are initiated. In assaults only auxiliaries climb the walls. They are supported by suppressing fire from the attacker's bowmen and arquebusiers. Cavalry, pikemen and feudal levies do not participate directly in assault. When all defending garrison troops are killed, the character ordering the assault receives all of the funds in the town that have been set aside for taxes, tithes, tolls, tariffs and amercements.
An assault starts with the infliction of casualties upon the assaulting auxiliaries by the defending garrison troops. Each garrison troop kills a number of auxiliaries equal to ((N-B-Q) x FAS/1000)/1000. (N=the town's total loyalty to all families minus twice the town's loyalty to the asssaulter's family. B=the attacker's number of bowmen times their morale divided by 3,000. Q=the attacker's number of arquebusiers times their morale divided by 3,000. FAS=the town's Fortification Against Assault. If N-B-Q is calculated to be less than 100, then N-B-Q is deemed to be 100.) The assaulter's surviving auxiliaries each kill the defending garrison troops according to the following formula: M/1000 x (Mi/1000+S/1000). (M=the auxiliaries' morale. Mi=the assaulter's military rating. S=the size of the assaulter's strongpoing, if any, at the location being assault.) 
Should any garrison troops survive, no plunder is obtained.
Succeeding in plundering a town does not give the plunderer de facto control. Morale changes are equal to 1/10th of the difference in total kills extracted.

### Siege bombardment of strongpoint
Siege bombardment can be used to reduce the size of a strongpoint. Bombardment orders are executed 72 hours after they are issued. Each cannon reduces the strongpoint by a number of points equal to the bombarder's gunnery rating divided by 500. Each cannon suffers impairment of 2% each time it is used in bombardment.

### Siege bombardment of town
Siege bombardment can be used to reduce the FAS (Fortification Against Assault) of a town. Bombardment orders are executed 72 hours after they are issued. Each cannon reduces FAS by a number of points equal to 1/500th of the excess of the bombarder's gunnery rating over the town's FAR (Fortification Against Artillery). Each cannon suffers impairment of 2% each time it is used in bombardment.

## Other
--------

### Alcohol
Wine, beer, ale or spirits may be given to troops, or crew, to raise their morale. No more than one unit of alcohol may be imbibed per man per day. The increase per unit of alcohol is equal to 20 plus one one thousandth of the character's intoxication rating. Should the number of units of alcohol be smaller than the number of recipients, the morale increase is proportionately reduced. (To qualify to be used for this purpose, it is not sufficient that a trade good be a type of alcohol, wine, ale, beer or spirits. It must be listed as wine, beer, ale or spirits in the asset list of the character.)

### Assassination
Assassination attempts may be carried out by males with an assassination skill rating greater than zero. Attempts take place immediately upon being ordered. They cause the victim to suffer a health loss equal to one-tenth of the total of the following: the assassin's assassination rating minus 100 plus the assassin's health rating minus one-tenth of the victim's personal troop total (excluding crew) minus the victim's assassination skill rating minus one-tenth of the location's hospital size minus half the value of the victim's family's strongpoint at the location. (Aa-100+Ha-T/10-Av-Ho/10-S/2)/20. (Aa = assassin's assassination rating; Ha = assassin's health rating; T = victim's personal troop total including crew; Av = victim's assassination skill rating; Ho = location's hospital size; S = the victim's family's strongpoint at the location). If the victim's health rating is at, or below, zero at the time of the next daily update, he dies. Assassination skill may be used no more than once per 60 days. Each assassination attempt reduces the potential assassin's prestige by 300 points. The name of the perpetrator of an assassination attempt is mentioned in the events listing.

### Challenge
Any male over 15 who has a dueling rating above zero may challenge to a duel any other male over 15 present at the same location. Doing so adds one point to the challenger's prestige and ties up his dueling skill for 7 days.

### Dueling
A duel results when a challenge is accepted. The accepter must have a dueling rating. Results are based on the parties' dueling ratings and their choice of a preference in each of fourteen duel options. Preferences are permanent until changed by the player. They may not be changed between the acceptance of a challenge and the carrying out of the duel. Participants may lose health, and they may gain, or lose, prestige.Dueling skill is required for the issuance, or acceptance, of challenges.

### Naval battle
A naval battle takes place when a naval blockade is traversed by someone not belonging to the same League, or family, as the blockader. Naval battles occur in stages. In the first stage, falconets are fired. Three falconets may be fired per galley, two per roundship, one per caravel and one per galliot. Each fired falconet kills a number of enemy troops equal to 100 x N x G, with N being the firer's navigation rating divided by 1,000 and G being the firer's gunnery rating divided by 1,000. Losses are apportioned proportionately among all troop types. (Crew are treated as troops in all aspects of naval battle.) In the next stage, galleys belonging to the combatant with the higher navigation rating ram opposing vessels. Each ramming galley destroys a number of enemy ships equal 1/1,000 of the difference in navigation ratings between the two combatants. Ship losses are apportioned proportionately among the ship types on the rammed side. Should the destruction of shipping leave one side with insufficient capacity to hold all of its troops, the excess troops are lost. In the next stage, each bowman kills a number of opposing troops equal to his commander's navigation rating divided by 1,000 multiplied by the bowmen's morale divided by 1,000. In the next stage, arquebusiers each kill at half the rate of bowmen. The final stage is a melee in which each troop kills a number of enemies equal to 0.3 x Mi/1,000 x N/1,000 x Mo/1,000 (with Mi being military skill and Mo being the weighted average morale for all troops on the killer's side.) After the battle, if the blockade-runner has at least one troop and one ship remaining, he continues on to his destination. Should either participant end up with no troops, or no ships, he ends up in the port town where the battle took place, still in possession of his coins but without his trade goods or troops. If the blockader survives the battle with at least one ship and one troop, the blockade continues. (Naval blockades, however, are terminated during the daily update when the blockader has insufficient crew to man his ships.) Morale is adjusted after the battle. The side that suffered the fewer losses gains a number of morale points equal to 10% of the difference in losses. The other side loses the same number of points. Troops with morale of zero, or less, desert during the next daily update. The maximum morale allowed in naval battles is 3,000. Participants in a naval battle gain two points of navigation skill and one point of military skill. If they fire falconets, they also gain one point of gunnery skill.

### Strongpoint
Each family may own a strongpoint at each location. Strongpoint ownership raises the overall ranking of members of the owning family. Strongpoints facilitate trade with townspeople, play a role in military activities and serve as depots for trade goods. Building, or adding to, a strongpoint requires the expenditure of 8,000 coins and 100 construction materials of one type. The strongpoint's size increase is roughly equal to the square root of the builder's fortification skill. It ties up the builder's fortification skill for seven days minus a number of minutes equal to his fortification skill.

Strongpoints may hold in storage any one type of trade good. Goods may be transferred to the strongpoint solely by members of the family that owns it. Goods may be transferred from the strongpoint solely to members of the family that owns it.

Strongpoint garrisons consist of troops transferred to the strongpoint by members of the owning family. Once transferred to the strongpoint, they lose their type identity and become ordinary strongpoint garrison troops. For example, heavy cavalry and auxiliaries both become ordinary strongpoint garrison troops. Neither feudal levy troops, nor crew, may be transferred to strongpoints. Once transferred to a strongpoint, troops may not be transferred away from the strongpoint.
Stronpoints lose 0.1 points of size per day. When they fall below 1.0 in size, they cease to exist. When a strongpoint ceases to exist, all of its contents are lost.

When an Abbey is not affiliated with a specific monastic order, its abbot is appointed by the Bishop in whose see the Abbey is located. Appointees must be tonsured males. Abbots are members of their Cathedral Chapter.

## Anathema
The Pope may anathematize a Catholic. Doing so reduces the latter's reputation for piety by a number of points equal to 10% of the Pope's sermonizing skill. It ties up that skill for one week, and uses up one initiative.
## Annates
When a Bishop, or Archbishop, takes office, his customary payment to the Pope is simulated by the automatic transfer to the Pope of the tithe accumulation at the seat of the bishopric, or archbishopric.
## Annulment of Marriage
Upon request, the Pope may annul Catholic marriages for a fee of 10,000 coins. Doing so ties up his administration skill for seven days.
## Apostolic Protonotary
The Pope may appoint any number of Apostolic Protonotaries. Only tonsured Catholic males with law skill ratings of at least 1,000 are eligible. 25 coins are paid by the Pope to each Apostolic Protonotary each day. The Pope receives 0.1 extra initiatives each day per Apostolic Protonotary. Apostolic Protonotaries gain 0.1 prestige per day. When appointing an Apostolic Protonotary, the Pope may indicate that he is replacing a specific existing Apostolic Protonotary -- thereby removing him from this office.

Archpriests affect the effectiveness of attending mass. They are members of their Cathedral Chapter.

## Archbishop
Archbishops are selected by their Cathedral Chapter. The members of their Cathedral Chapter consist of all archpriests and abbots in their archiepiscopal see plus all bishops subject to their archiepiscopal see. The Pope and any Nuncio present are able to vote as ex officio members. In addition to votes actively cast, candidates receive a number of votes equal to their reputation for piety divided by 300 plus their politics skill divided by 1,000 plus their prestige divided by 1,000. To qualify for election, a candidate must vote for himself. Upon election a new archbishop is divested of any other episcopal titles he may hold. When an archbishop is elected, all accumulated tithes held in the seat of his archbishopric are transferred to the Pope as Annates.

Archbishops participate in the selection of bishops whose sees fall under their rule. Archbishops have the rights of bishops over towns that are under their direct episcopal rule. Archbishops gain 0.3 prestige per day.
## Arquebus
Arquebuses are used to equip arquebusiers. They may also be used to meet a town's demand for weapons. Arquebuses may be produced through the expenditure of a total of one one unit of iron, one timber, one sulfur, one saltpeter and one charcoal plus one coin per arquebus. Coins expended to produce arquebuses are added to the town's wealth. In one action, a character may produce a number of arquebuses equal to the square root of his gunsmithing rating. His gunsmithing rating may not be used again for three days minus a number of minutes equal to the total of his gunsmithing rating plus the rating of the town's armory structure. When arquebuses are produced in a town with a pre-existing Armory, the Armory increases in size by 0.1 points.

## Arquebusiers
To recruit arquebusiers, one must expend 40 coins and one arquebus per recruit. Each character may hold 200 arquebusiers free of maintenance. Any additional arquebusiers require 0.2 units of grain per day in maintenance. If unmaintained, these excess arquebusiers suffer one percent attrition per day. Arquebusiers fight most effectively in forested terrain. They provide suppressing fire in assaults on towns or strongpoints.
## Bishop
Bishops are elected by their Cathedral Chapter. The members of their Cathedral Chapter consist of all archpriests and abbots in their episcopal see. The Pope, the Archbishop overseeing the bishopric and any Nuncio present are able to vote as ex officio members. In addition to votes actively cast, candidates receive a number of votes equal to their reputation for piety divided by 300 plus their politics skill divided by 1,000 plus their prestige divided by 1,000. To qualify for election, a candidate must vote for himself. Upon election a new bishop is divested of any other episcopal title he may hold. When a bishop is elected, all accumulated tithes held in the seat of his bishopric are transferred to the Pope as Annates.

Bishops appoint archpriests for Churches located in towns within their episcopal sees. When an Abbey, or Convent, is not affiliated with a specific monastic order, Bishops appoint their Abbot, or Abbess. Bishops may collect the tithes accumulated in the towns within their see. Collecting tithes ties up their administrative skill for 48 hours minus a number of minutes equal to their administrative skill. Bishops gain 0.2 prestige per day.

His reputation for piety increases by a number of points equal to 1/1,000 of the total of the size of the Church plus the Archpriest's sermonizing rating plus the attendee's churchgoing rating. Mass may not be attended more than once every 24 hours.

## Monastic order
To join a monastic order, one must be tonsured. Only the head of the order may admit new members. The head of each order is elected for life by the membership of that order.

## Piety
Reputation for piety increases through pilgrimage, attendance at mass and the veneration of relics. It plays a role in obtaining ecclesiastical offices.

## Pilgrimage
Italy has nine Catholic pilgrimage sites. Each one has a specific day of the year favored by pilgrims. Any Catholic present at one of these sites on its day may 'complete a pilgrimage'. Completed pilgrimages earn the pilgrim 100 points of piety and 100 points of pilgrimage skill. No more than one pilgrimage may be completed per 367 days. The pilgrimage sites (and their day) are Amalfi (November 30), Assisi (August 12), Bari (December 6), Loreto (December 10), Lucca (May 3), Milan (September 17), Naples (September 19), Rome (June 29) and Siena (April 29).

Palestine has three additional Catholic pilgrimage sites, each worth 300 points of piety. They are Jerusalem (March 18), Nazareth (July 22) and Bethlehem (August 18).

## Pope
The Pope is elected for life by the College of Cardinals.
The Pope appoints Apostolic Protonotaries, Nuncios and Cardinals. Making one of these appointments ties up his administration skill for ten days. Holders of Papal Offices receive 0.1 prestige per day. Nuncios receive an additional 0.4 prestige per day. Cardinals receive an additional 0.5 prestige per day.
The Pope serves as Bishop of Rome. He plays a role in the selection of all bishops and archbishops. He receives Annates from new bishops and archbishops. He may excommunicate Catholics. He is sovereign over the Papal States and Avignon and may appoint Court Officers as a Suzerain. Whenever the papacy is vacant, an election may be initiated by any cardinal by casting a vote while in Rome. Any Cardinal present at Rome is eligible to vote. The election ends thirty days after the casting of the first vote. Upon election, a new Pope is immediately divested of all non-hereditary positions he holds. In the election, in addition to the votes actively cast by Cardinals, each candidate receives a number of votes equal to his reputation for piety divided by 1,000.
## Relics
Donating a Catholic relic to a Church increases the donor's prestige by 150, the donor's piety by 150, the size of the Church by 150 and the town's loyalty to the donor's family by 150.
Once per month, the possessor of relics may venerate them. Veneration increases the venerator's piety rating by ten points for each relic being venerated. The local Church gains one point for each relic being venerated.
## Tithe
During the daily update 2/10,000 of a town's wealth is transferred to its accumulated tithe account. This accumulation may be picked up at any time by the bishop in whose see a town falls. When a Catholic town does not fall into a bishop's see, it is directly under the control of its archbishop, who may collect the tithe himself. Collecting the accumulated tithes ties up the collector's administration skill for 48 hours minus a number of minutes equal to his administration skill.

## Tonsure
To obtain any ecclesiastical position, one must be tonsured. Any unmarried person with a reputation for piety of at least 100 may request tonsuring. Any bishop or archbishop present at the same location may then grant tonsuring.
